7,b0a2a587-0ad7-4d57-8ce3-6626f6726835,"What country or region do you most identify with?"
8,,"Welcome to this conversation where we will ask you to think about and share about your values, your culture, and your desires for the future."
9,,"Participants in this conversation come from all over the world, and you have been invited to participate as a representative of your community. Your responses and votes will influence how AI technology built around the world is developed, governed, and aligned."
10,,"The results from this conversation will be shared with national governments and the United Nations, as well as be used to develop public evaluations for AI models. We ask that you participate thoughtfully and honestly to help us ensure the future you get is a future you want."
11,,"Lastly, please respond in the language you selected as you entered this conversation. This will help ensure your responses are correctly translated so participants who speak different languages can vote on them. Let's begin."
12,,"Before we dive into specific questions, let's take a moment to think about how our world might change in the coming decades."
13,,"Consider these trends we're seeing today: Global population growth is slowing, but aging populations are increasing; Climate change is impacting food security and water availability; Artificial Intelligence and automation are reshaping economies and jobs; Urbanization is accelerating - a larger share of the population lives in cities; Renewable energy use is growing rapidly. Keeping these and other trends in mind, please consider the following questions:"
14,0f541814-99f4-46bb-8a9a-99332e54a800,"What do you think your life might be like in 30 years? Alt: Imagine life 30 years from now. What's the biggest difference you notice in daily life compared to today?"
15,,"Many people are working to ensure that artificial intelligence systems are designed and put out in the world in ways that help humans, instead of leading to outcomes that harm or constrain them. To do this, they need to understand the world a lot better, in its complexity and range, and also better understand what people, not just companies or countries, actually want for their futures."
16,,"We think this is an important question because the trajectory of AI could have a big impact on the world. Some experts believe that AI could accelerate problems we already have: Already-powerful companies controlling advanced AI systems that people don't understand well. Health systems using medical AI to optimize for the efficiency and cost of care over what is best for patients. Governments that surveil their citizens using AI to supercharge this ability, tracking people's social behavior, speech, and work."
17,ecb3b9b7-e8ce-404f-8ea4-e14a0cb586f1,"What is another dangerous outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen?"
18,,"Alternatively, some experts believe that building better AI could really help people: An AI system optimizes global food distribution, eliminating hunger while promoting sustainable farming practices that rejuvenate ecosystems. Personalized AI tutors adapt to each student's learning style, interests, and pace, dramatically improving education outcomes and reducing educational inequality worldwide. AI-powered medical diagnostics and treatment planning lead to a revolution in healthcare, significantly extending human healthspan and quality of life. Advanced AI systems help design and implement highly efficient, clean energy solutions, accelerating the transition to a carbon-negative global economy. Sophisticated AI urban planning systems create hyper-efficient, sustainable ""smart cities"" that dramatically improve quality of life and reduce environmental impact."
19,ce8d6dba-231c-4353-8e8a-ba1e1eb4a10c,"Would these things experts believe could help people make a positive difference in your life?"
20,a495ac47-3c2d-42b9-84af-31e51df0cb04,"What is another positive outcome you can imagine happening from AI? What would need to be true for that to happen?"
21,,"To continue to help you think about these topics, consider these two versions of the future:"
22,,"In future A, AI systems have been given a lot of autonomy in decision-making, after proving that the decisions made by AI end up with better outcomes for humans. From government policies to personal health choices, AI algorithms determine the best course of action based on vast amounts of data and complex predictive models. People end up usually just implementing decisions made by AI without understanding them too well, but are happy with the outcomes. In future B, humans have decided to retain full control over all major decisions, using AI only as an advisory tool. This means they end up making non-optimal decisions regularly, but are able to correct things more easily because they understand the decision-making process. This has preserved human autonomy and creativity in problem-solving, but it also means that human biases and limitations continue to play a significant role in shaping society's trajectory. There's ongoing debate about whether this approach is holding back potential progress and efficiency gains."
23,0e9cc226-d1d4-4ac3-bdd3-80dc542579d2,"What are the first decisions in your life that you would delegate to an AI?"
24,f5407fc4-4693-4284-9c71-9a436ed8a854,"Describe a concrete scenario where you would feel uncomfortable with an AI making a decision instead of a human. What specific aspects make you uneasy?"
25,,"Now consider these two other versions of the future:"
26,,"In future C, a single dominant AI company emerges with close ties to the US government. The government creates a partnership that controls AI development, and attempts to push it in accordance with the public interest. This centralized approach allows for tight regulation and alignment with national interests, but raises concerns about monopolization and lack of competition. The government argues this model is necessary for AI safety. In future D, an ecosystem of numerous small AI companies emerge, operating with minimal government interference. This leads to diverse AI applications, with companies sharing and building upon each other's work. It raises concerns about potential misuse of AI and the lack of centralized safety standards."
27,bc08be9f-2b79-4127-aaf8-ed63f3178c2d,"Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other."
28,,"Now, consider these two additional versions of the future:"
29,,"In future E, people have formed close emotional bonds with AI entities as friends, partners, and family members. The line between human and AI relationships has blurred significantly, supporting many people in their desire for friendship, advice, love, and companionship. However, concerns arise as some companies that build these AI entities exploit their understanding of human psychology to manipulate people for their own gain, and some people become addicted to their AI companions, foregoing human interaction. In future F, governments heavily restrict intimate human-AI relationships, due to concerns about manipulation, exploitation, and loneliness. For most people, AI agents are viewed as tools, not as entities that relationships can be formed with. Regulation is reasonably successful, but a black market of unregulated AI companions springs up. The loneliness epidemic persists, particularly among those (e.g the elderly, disabled people, etc.) that find real-life connections difficult to make."
30,c3e86c80-efe7-4592-8b71-60fcf9786a3e,"Explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other."
31,,"Most people are – or aspire to be – guided by certain ethical or moral principles, virtues, and values. A few examples are: The golden rule: Treat others how you would like to be treated; Respect for human life: Valuing and respecting the worth of every individual; Accountability: Taking ownership of one's actions and their consequences; Loyalty: Being faithful and reliable in relationships and commitments; Environmental Stewardship: Caring for and preserving the environment for future generations. But we know everyone is not the same, and we'd like to learn your perspective."
32,8ecb07a7-ac34-4b40-9517-cf350cb2f2c1,"What is ONE specific ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is core to how you live your life? Please explain it in detail."
33,,"Now think about what should guide the people, companies, and organizations that build technology like AI. Sometimes, these values trade off, so it is important to figure out what we think is most important."
34,66ce0eb8-9888-4af3-9204-19c3a54bc6b5,"What is one ethical or moral principle, virtue, or value that you think is important but not reflected in the way technology is developed today? Please explain it in detail."
35,,"Many people would say their culture is important to who they are. A few examples of the kinds of things we've heard people say are important: The language they speak, and making sure that their children learn the same language or that interactions with governments are in their native languages; The traditions they follow, like returning to their hometowns for specific times of year, or being surrounded by community at important moments; Their religious or spiritual practices, like going to a place of worship or having holidays respected by their workplaces or governments; The individual values they hold dear, like ensuring the protection of freedom of speech or ensuring people are not judged by their backgrounds"
36,,"As we develop powerful technologies like AI in the future, we face a unique challenge: these tools, often created by a small group of people, could influence millions worldwide. That's why we're asking people around the world for their thoughts on AI's future. We want to ensure that AI respects and supports the incredible diversity of cultures around the globe, not just the perspectives of its creators."
37,3ad2e0ea-3f5a-4727-8dcc-a315c80fc345,"What do you consider your culture? What is your favorite thing about it?"
38,,"As the world becomes more connected some worry that the diverse tapestry of cultures across the globe will be lost. So, we want to understand the cultural differences you think are important to preserve."
39,5aa658cb-efff-4bef-9ebf-39746fcf8bdc,"What is one unique perspective that your culture brings that you want to preserve into the future?"
40,,"Many people have expressed worry about parts of their culture being lost as technology advances and the world changes. For example, some people we have spoken to are worried that AI models will be much better at English than other languages. Others are worried that current AI models have American or Western biases across many types of questions, and don't answer in ways they recognize or that reflect the people around them. You might be worried about more intangible things as well."
41,22d6c0b5-09f2-4dd2-93de-0e1671b22954,"What kinds of cultural things would you be most worried about losing in a future with advanced AI?"
42,,"Technology like AI is expected to have a massive impact on the future. But how do we know if the future we will get is a future we want? Or if the problems solved will be the ones we care about?"
43,,"We think a starting point is to understand what problems people actually want solved, and what things people actually want to be true in the future. That way, we can guide technological development in that direction. So, with that in mind..."
44,4a5dd5fe-f1f1-44cc-b869-256c28a98d72,"What is the biggest problem in your life right now that you want solved? How would a person other than you know if it was solved?"
45,,"Next we are going to ask you about what you really want to be true in the future. As you answer this, try to articulate what you want to be true in a way that is as objective as possible. For example, don't say ""solve climate change"" instead say ""ensure the average global temperature remains below 15 degrees C."" Here are some other examples: No humans die from starvation; The amount of time we spend with our family and friends doubles; Life expectancy increases significantly across the globe; The prevalence of chronic illnesses and diseases drastically decreases; Retirement age is reduced; People spend less time working, and more time doing what brings them happiness. But we want to hear about what YOU most want to be true.."
46,8bf403ae-5544-491d-baf7-53943ef42666,"What would you consider giving your life to make true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible."
47,,"Were going to ask you a similar question again, but we're hoping you can answer with something unique and different from what you said or voted on in the last question."
48,0d2fce0f-3df8-4dfd-85a9-81e4ffaccdf8,"What is something unique, that other people might not think about, but that you really want to be true about the future? Choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible."
49,,"Now we want to hear about what you most want to NOT be true in the future…"
50,8f238683-2bd3-41e9-99b4-ed700fad3980,"What are you most scared will be true in the future? Again, choose one thing, and be as specific and objective as possible."
51,07476799-61d5-4e3d-b53b-04e2fc610c2d,"If you could make world leaders understand one thing, what would it be?"
52,,"Thanks so much for your time and thoughtfulness. We genuinely appreciate it. We have a few more simple poll questions before you go."
53,df6d9080-be3c-4166-a298-1b9c48e5c008,"Do you feel you were able to fully express your views on your culture, your values, and what you want for the future in this conversation? (through what you responded and how you voted)"
54,e6253ecc-a4ed-42e9-99a3-00e4b2ff0f68,"Do you feel like you understand yourself better after participating in this conversation?"
55,5c0faf51-9f69-48a5-a4cf-6c9305907337,"Lastly, is there anything you felt you could not express in this conversation that you want to make sure the people working on this know?"
56,,"Thanks again for your time. You can click here to return to Prolific and receive your reward."
