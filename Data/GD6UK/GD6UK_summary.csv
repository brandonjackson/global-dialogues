While regular use of AI for basic tasks is widespread—especially for information, productivity, and personal organization—hesitation persists around deeper autonomy and delegation, particularly for sensitive functions involving family, finances, legal decisions, and medical matters. Participants overwhelmingly value user control, transparency, clear consent, and the ability to view, edit, and delete personal data, expressing substantial discomfort with AI accessing or acting on highly private information such as messages or legal commitments; most prefer explicit permission for each significant action, even at the expense of efficiency. Trust in AI varies: participants largely distrust government, social media, and large corporations, show mixed but cautious trust toward AI companies and chatbots, and retain strong trust only in small businesses, family doctors, and public research institutions. Attitudes toward AI’s societal impact are nuanced: messaging apps are viewed as net positive, social media as net negative, AI chatbots as somewhat beneficial, and advanced autonomous AI as risky, especially regarding jobs—where most expect worsening opportunities. While many appreciate AI’s helpfulness and potential for streamlining tasks, they fear privacy breaches, loss of agency, harm from mistakes, and insufficient human oversight. Even as AI is seen as dependable for routine management, most oppose delegating “sacred” human decisions or letting AI override rules without consent. There is broad agreement that preventing harm should be AI’s top priority and that transparency and recourse to human support are critical for trust. Although users are open to AI becoming more helpful and personalized—accepting some trade-offs in privacy—strong concerns remain about data sharing and external access. Overall, feelings about AI’s integration are balanced between excitement and concern, with people wanting robust privacy protections, clear accountability for errors, and meaningful user agency as AI becomes further embedded into everyday life."

684f9c1d-01d4-42ca-b6eb-4190c0fe2c32,Ask Experience,"What has been the most noticeable change in your daily life, if any, as a result of AI in the past year?","The Remesh opinion question explored the most noticeable changes in participants' daily lives as a result of AI over the past year. Analysis of the narrative responses reveals that AI has become increasingly integrated into both professional and personal routines, often in ways that participants did not initially recognize. Many participants described a growing reliance on AI-powered tools for tasks such as drafting emails, summarizing information, conducting research, and organizing personal duties. One participant noted, 'I now use it to draft emails, summarize long texts, and get quick explanations, which saves me time and helps me focus on higher-value work.' Another highlighted, 'AI has simplified many aspects of my daily life, it can provide a detailed report on any subject I ask in just moments.'A notable theme is the shift in information-seeking behavior, with participants frequently referencing the prevalence of AI-generated summaries at the top of search results and reviews. This has led to faster access to information and a reduction in the need to visit multiple websites. As one participant stated, 'I get better answers on Google as there is always the AI generated text whenever you ask something. It means it's quicker to find a full answer.'Customer service interactions have also been notably affected, with several participants mentioning the increased use of AI chatbots when contacting companies. While some found this efficient, others expressed a preference for human interaction, noting that complex queries are often beyond the capabilities of current AI systems.Efficiency and productivity gains were frequently cited, with participants reporting that AI has helped them complete tasks more quickly and with greater accuracy. For example, one participant remarked, 'Now I am at least 50 -70% faster and also more succinct or considered in my own output.'Despite these changes, a minority of participants indicated little to no noticeable impact from AI in their daily lives, either due to limited use or lack of awareness. Others expressed a growing awareness of AI-generated content, particularly on social media, and some skepticism regarding the authenticity of information encountered online.Overall, the responses suggest that AI has become a regular, often indispensable, part of daily life for many participants, streamlining tasks, enhancing productivity, and altering the way information is accessed and processed. However, the transition has also brought challenges, such as reduced human interaction in customer service and concerns about the reliability of AI-generated content."

b25117ff-66b8-4325-82dd-e6e3c9e379af,Ask Experience,Explain why you gave that trust score to your AI chatbot.,"The Remesh opinion question explored participants' reasoning behind the trust scores they assigned to their AI chatbot experiences. Responses reveal a nuanced landscape of trust, shaped by perceptions of objectivity, reliability, and the inherent limitations of AI systems. Many participants cited the non-human, emotionless nature of chatbots as a basis for expecting objective responses, with one stating, 'Because it isn't human, it is something that doesn't have feelings so is more likely to give an objective response.' However, this lack of sentience also led to skepticism regarding the chatbot's ability to act in users' best interests, as reflected in comments such as, 'I dont believe it is programmed to act in my best interests, I dont think my best interests come into it at all.'Participants frequently described AI chatbots as useful tools for information retrieval, summarization, and decision support, with some highlighting their speed and consistency. One participant noted, 'It can quickly process information and give me feedback, summaries, paraphrases...help in the process of decision making by laying out the pros and cons.' Despite these strengths, concerns about accuracy and reliability were prevalent. Several participants reported that chatbots can be 'confidently wrong' or provide 'wildly wrong response[s],' necessitating independent verification of information. As one response summarized, 'It produces useful information that is mostly accurate, but not accurate enough to rely on without checking other sources.'The issue of bias and the influence of training data and programming were also raised. Some participants expressed trust in the neutrality of chatbots, while others were wary of potential unconscious bias or the motivations of those who design and train these systems. For example, one participant remarked, 'It depends on who is behind it and their motivation. Some are relatively harmless, some not so but the users are not their priority.'Overall, the findings indicate that trust in AI chatbots is conditional and context-dependent. Participants generally view chatbots as helpful and efficient for routine or low-stakes tasks but remain cautious about relying on them for sensitive or critical matters. The need for user vigilance, cross-checking of information, and awareness of the chatbot's limitations is a recurring theme. The responses suggest that while AI chatbots are valued as knowledge tools, trust is moderated by concerns about accuracy, bias, and the absence of human judgment or empathy."
