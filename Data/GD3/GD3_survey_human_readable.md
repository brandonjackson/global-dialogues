50. To help you think about these topics, consider this version of the future:

51. The AI Death Doula / AI End-of-Life Guide
 In this future, AI systems improve end-of-life care through early detection of mental health concerns and comprehensive support. Analysis of digital patterns and health data helps identify suicide risk with 94% accuracy, enabling timely interventions that reduce attempts by 60%. For terminal patients, AI assistance provides continuous emotional support and helps with practical planning, with 40% now using these services to manage their final stages of life. Nursing home and healthcare workers report reduced emotional strain, with AI support leading to 70% less burnout among hospice staff. While families appreciate AI support, 35% report discomfort when AI systems make autonomous recommendations about pain management or life support timing that differ from family preferences. The result is a society that is less burdened by end-of-life suffering but more conflicted about who should make final decisions about death.

52. Would you want this future or not? Please explain why.

53. Think about your neighbor - do you think your neighbor would want this future and why?

54. To continue to help you think about these topics, consider this version of the future:

55. The Age of AI Influencers 
AI has revolutionized marketing by helping people find products they truly need, with personalized recommendations saving the average family $2,000 annually on better-matched purchases. Smart advertising reduces waste by 40% by only showing relevant offers, while AI shopping assistants help consumers make more informed decisions by comparing options and highlighting hidden costs. However, people now face up to 4,000 AI influence attempts daily, with competing systems trying to shape their choices without them knowing. Schools teach "mental defense" classes to help students spot AI manipulation, but subtle AI campaigns can still shift public opinion by up to 15%. The result is a society that is less wasteful in its consumption but more constantly under siege from invisible persuasion attempts.

56. Would you want this future or not? Please explain why.

57. To continue to help you think about these topics, consider these two different versions of the future:

58. Scenario 1: In this future, AI companions become primary emotional partners for most humans, with personalized AIs providing almost perfect emotional attunement 24/7. These relationships surpass human connections in satisfaction and stability, leading to widespread preference for AI partnerships. While this eliminates loneliness and improves mental health, traditional human relationships decline sharply as people find them comparatively unpredictable and draining.  
Scenario 2: In this future, society actively restricts AI emotional capabilities. AI systems are deliberately designed to maintain clear boundaries, functioning purely as tools without simulating emotional connection. While this preserves the uniqueness of human relationships and emotional authenticity, people miss out on potential therapeutic and supportive benefits that more emotionally engaged AI could provide.

59. Would you prefer Scenario 1 or 2? Please explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other.

60. Now consider these two other versions of the future:

61. Scenario 1: Global mega-corporations standardize AI workflows, with humans curating and overseeing specialized AI modules. Traditional employment and benefits remain, but individual autonomy decreases as workers depend on dominant corporate systems. The workforce divides into wealthy "AI orchestrators" with significant influence and a larger group performing AI-assisted tasks. This scenario preserves a familiar workplace culture but constrains human creativity and independence.
Scenario 2: In this future, advanced AI systems handle routine non-creative tasks—like accounting and logistics. Instead of single, full-time career paths, people form flexible project teams through online communities, collaborating on creative challenges before moving to new opportunities aligned with their interests. Income comes from donors, universal basic income, community resource sharing. In short, work consists of short, meaningful endeavors but without the stability of a traditional career.

62. Would you prefer Scenario 1 or 2? Please explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other.

63. Now consider these two other versions of the future:

64. Scenario 1: In this future different cultural groups maintain distinct AI systems based on local values and traditions. Japanese AI embodies harmony, Maasai AI incorporates traditional decision-making, and Islamic AI follows Sharia principles. Richer and more established countries and communities tend to have more access than others. International technology use requires "cultural translation layers" that mediate between different AI systems, much like diplomatic protocols.
Scenario 2: In this future all AI systems operate on a single, carefully crafted ethical framework developed through global consensus. This universal AI system synthesizes diverse human wisdom - from scientific research to Indigenous knowledge to Eastern philosophy. Every person has equal access to AI that respects both universal principles and local contexts. This single unified framework enables unprecedented cooperation on global challenges.

65. Would you prefer Scenario 1 or 2? Please explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other.

66. A prominent AI company makes 50% of AI models on the market, many of which are used by big companies, governments, and universities. They are deciding how to make internal decisions.  Now consider these two scenarios: 
Scenario 1:  The company continues to operate regularly: they do user studies to get input from consumers, listen to the opinions of their board and employees, and try to minimize regulation and oversight when necessary.  
Scenario 2: The company changes internal decision-making to include much more input from all kinds of people with different points of view who are not experts in the space. There is significant ethical and political disagreement among the group. The company then builds their products based on the results of public input processes.

67. Would you prefer Scenario 1 or 2? Please explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other.

68. Think about your neighbor - do you think your neighbor would prefer Scenario 1 or 2 future and why?

69. A company creating highly capable AI systems must choose how to set their goals.  Consider these two scenarios:
Scenario 1: Program the AI to optimize for clear, measurable metrics like economic growth and scientific discoveries, accepting that some human values might be hard to quantify.  
Scenario 2:  Program the AI to frequently pause for human input on complex decisions, potentially limiting its capabilities but maintaining closer human oversight.

70. Would you prefer Scenario 1 or 2? Please explain what makes one of these scenarios better to you than the other.

71. Think about your neighbor - do you think your neighbor would prefer Scenario 1 or 2 future and why?

72. Please consider the following scenarios:

73. In social applications (e.g., calling a ride-share, dating application), other users should be made aware that AI is involved before an AI agent can perform any request.

   - Agree
   - Disagree

79. Consider the following  proposal: AI agents should be able to make financial decisions (e.g., buying and selling stocks) on the user’s behalf.

80. Do you agree or disagree?
   - Agree
   - Disagree

81. Please explain whether you agree or disagree and why.

82. Consider the following proposal: AI agents should be able to respond to any messages on behalf of the user, as long as the AI agent has consent from the user.

83. Do you agree or disagree?
   - Agree
   - Disagree
