My top concerns regarding AI in interspecies communication are:

Misinterpretation: AI could misinterpret animal signals due to context blindness or inherent biases, leading to dangerous or incorrect responses.

Exploitation/Misuse: The ability to ""talk"" to animals opens doors for manipulating them for human gain (e.g., entertainment, resource extraction), violating their autonomy.

Ethical Breaches: Issues of animal privacy, consent, and potential erosion of their wildness through constant hum"

This is related to many aspects, including laws and policies. Whether the biologists' ideas can truly protect nature as a whole. c Great apes will have rights earlier because they are closer to humans, so should other animals also have these basic rights?
