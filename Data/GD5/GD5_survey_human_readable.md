    - Unsettled
    - Unchanged
    - Other

46. Now that we understand your relationship with animals, let's explore how differently they might experience the world around us.

47. Every animal experiences the world differently based on their unique senses. Some scientists refer to this as an animal's 'umwelt' - their perceptual world. For example, bees can see ultraviolet patterns on flowers that are invisible to humans. Dolphins use echolocation to 'see' with sound. Dogs experience rich scent landscapes we can't imagine. Sharks detect electrical fields from other animals' heartbeats. Birds use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate during migration.

48. Have you ever tried to imagine experiencing the world through another animal's senses?
    - Yes, Often
    - Yes, sometimes
    - Rarely
    - Never
    - I am not sure what this means

49. Think about an animal you encounter regularly (like a pet, birds outside your window, or insects in your garden). What do you think their daily experience might be like through their senses?

50. How important do you think it is for humans to understand how other animals experience the world?
    - Very important
    - Somewhat important
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat unimportant
    - Very unimportant

51. Given the complexity in how animals experience the world, new AI technologies are being developed to help us better understand their communications. Now we are going to ask you your thoughts on those technologies.

52. AI is now being used by biologists, animal behavior experts, and researchers to analyze and discover patterns in animal communication, such as whale songs, bee dances, and elephant rumbles. This analysis has various applications: improving wildlife tracking and monitoring, designing more effective conservation strategies, and inspiring a deeper connection to the natural world. With these technological applications, humans can gain a better understanding of what animals are communicating. However, there are also risks associated with these technologies. Poachers might use the data to track migration patterns of animals. Companies might try to manipulate animal behavior in agriculture or entertainment.

53. Do you think this is a good use of AI technology?
    - Yes
    - No
    - It depends
    - Not sure

54. If AI technology was successfully developed to reliably interpret communication between humans and animals, how would you feel about this development?
    - Hopeful
    - Curious
    - Skeptical
    - Concerned
    - Indifferent
    - Other

55. If AI could reliably interpret animal communication, how interested would you be to know what animals "say" or "feel"?
    - Very interested
    - Somewhat interested
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat disinterested
    - Very disinterested

56. What is one question you would want to ask an animal if AI could interpret?

57. Assuming we have the ability to interpret animal communication, how much would you trust that AI could truly and comprehensively reflect what an animal is trying to communicate, without being distorted by AI's programming or human assumptions?
    - Strongly trust
    - Somewhat trust
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat distrust
    - Strongly distrust

58. Please explain your response

59. What concerns do you have regarding the use of AI in interspecies communication? (Please consider things like misinterpretation of animal/environmental signals, misuse of AI technology, ethical concerns, unforeseen ecological impacts)

60. AI is being used to help humans and wildlife live together peacefully. For example, in Thailand, India, and Tanzania, hundreds of humans and elephants die each year in conflicts that result from elephants raiding crops. AI-enabled cameras now warn people when elephants are near farms to prevent conflicts. Advancements in AI could enable a warning system that directly communicates to elephants to avoid crops.

61. Would you trust AI more or less than humans to interpret animal communication to resolve a human-wildlife conflict? Why?

62. If we could understand animals, many things about our world might change. For example, animal welfare might improve if we were able to understand what different animals need or want. Wildlife conservation might include input from species directly impacted. We might learn a lot about how the brains of other animals work. We might develop much deeper relationships with other non-human animals.

63. If we could understand animals, what would be the biggest benefit for our world?

64. What might be the biggest risk?

65. Soon scientists will be able use computer simulations of real animals to understand how they think and feel. Instead of using AI to directly talk to animals, people can ask the computer version how the animal might react, think, or feel.

66. Which approach do you think is best for humans to interact with non-humans?
    - Communicate directly using technology
    - Interact with a computer simulation of real non-human animals

67. Please explain why

68. If these AI technologies help us understand what animals are communicating, this could raise important questions about how they should be represented in decisions that affect them. Now we are going to ask you your thoughts on how best to do this.

69. Consider these three futures: A: Building Relationships: AI translation reveals that elephants are grieving the loss of family members to poaching and habitat loss. Recognizing their deep emotional lives, the local community works directly with the elephants to create designated quiet zones for mourning and establishes an ongoing dialogue to adapt to their changing needs. B: Shared decision-making: A government agency plans to approve a large-scale industrial fishing operation. AI-powered monitoring of marine life reveals the complex social structures and communication of dolphin pods and fish populations that will be catastrophically affected. The law is changed to create a formal "Marine Life Council" where biologists and ethologists are appointed as advocates to represent the interests of these animal communities. C: Legal Rights: A lawsuit is filed on behalf of a population of great apes in a research facility. Using AI-assisted translation as evidence of their self-awareness and desire for autonomy, the court grants the apes legal personhood. This means they can be represented by lawyers, have their interests defended in court, and possess fundamental rights through their appointed human guardians.

70. Which approach feels most appropriate to you for protecting animals?
    - Future A: Building ongoing relationships and communication
    - Future B: Including all voices in shared decision-making
    - Future C: Granting legal rights and representation

70_branch_a. Branch A - Please explain your response

70_branch_b. Branch B - Please explain your response

70_branch_c. Branch C - Please explain your response

71. The Rights of Nature movement is working to ensure that ecosystems and species such as rivers and orcas are granted legal rights in order to better protect them within human systems.

72. What kind of decisions should be informed by nature's voices?
    - How we relate with the environment (Environmental laws and protections)
    - How we build cities (Urban development and planning)
    - The way we produce and create food (Agriculture and food systems)
    - The things we teach in school (Education and media)
    - Who we elect (Local and national politics / government)
    - How we approach economics (Financial planning and systems)
    - How we treat human health and wellness (Prescribing nature solutions, e.g. to lower stress levels)
    - None of the above
    - Other

73. If AI helped us understand what an animal really needs, should that animal have the right to a representative such as a lawyer to defend its rights and protections?
    - Yes
    - No
    - Not sure

74. If AI could accurately express the voice of non-human animals, we might want to allow them to participate in decision-making. In this situation, which of these do you think is best?
    - Animals should have humans represent them when decisions are made that directly impact them
    - Animals should represent themselves (via tech assisted tools)

75. If animals were represented in decision-making bodies (e.g. the UN, local government, or corporate boards), who do you think should be given the responsibility of representing them?
    - Scientists who study animals
    - Animal protection organizations
    - A democratically elected representative
    - Technologies, including AI
    - Animals themselves / an animal ambassador
    - Your national government
    - A non profit institution
    - A local community advocate/ traditional / indigenous wisdom holder
    - Anyone who commits to a clear training program and mandate

76. Consider a scenario where societies of the future are governed by AI systems that integrate data from both human and non-human sources (such as environmental sensors and wildlife communication networks) to guide community decisions (e.g., urban planning, conservation zones). How appealing is this vision of an ecocentric, integrated society?
    - Not appealing
    - Somewhat appealing
    - Very appealing

77. If other animals had a voice and representation, should they be allowed to participate in human democratic processes?
    - Yes, they should be able to vote through human proxies or guardians.
    - Yes, they should be able to vote, but only on laws or decisions that directly affect them.
    - Yes, they should have a voice, but their vote should not be binding.
    - Yes, they should be recognized as a formal political constituency with dedicated representatives in government.
    - No, they should not be able to participate.
    - Other

78. What might be the most profound change to human society if animal and ecosystem voices were taken seriously in our laws and systems?

79. These new possibilities for animal representation also raise questions about how this technology should be developed and used responsibly. Now we are going to ask you your thoughts on how best to do this.

80. Imagine AI that could understand animal communication and read the signs of health or distress in an ecosystem. We might need to have protections to make sure this new power isn't abused. For example, perhaps animal communication should initially be restricted to trained professionals, with the goal of gradually expanding access to the broader public over time.

81. How much do you agree or disagree with the following statements:

82. Animal communication should be restricted to authorized professionals with certified credentials and appropriate training.
    - Strongly agree
    - Somewhat agree
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat disagree
    - Strongly disagree

83. Everyone should be allowed to listen to animals, but responding should be restricted to certain people.
    - Strongly agree
    - Somewhat agree
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat disagree
    - Strongly disagree

84. Companies that profit from animals (like farms, zoos, or entertainment industries) should be subject to strict rules about if, when, and how they can communicate with animals.
    - Strongly agree
    - Somewhat agree
    - Neutral
    - Somewhat disagree
    - Strongly disagree

85. Which of the following types of human-to-animal communication should be strictly regulated or prohibited? Select "None of the above" only if you think no regulations are needed and all communication should be allowed.
    - Communicating threats or inciting violence.
    - Deception or manipulation for commercial gain (e.g., tricking animals into appearing at a location for a tourism company).
    - Emotional manipulation for human attachment (e.g., trying to make an animal feel guilty for leaving a person).
    - Deception for what a human believes is the animal's "own good" (e.g., lying to a pet about a trip to the vet to keep it calm).
    - Commands that override an animal's natural instincts for a human benefit (e.g., ordering a guide animal into a situation it perceives as dangerous).
    - Persuading animals to permanently alter their natural behaviors or habitats (e.g., convincing a flock of birds to change its migration path).
    - None of the above

86. What other boundaries would you set?

87. If we can understand other animal communications, through AI, this raises some practical questions about ownership. We are going to ask you some questions about this now.

88. In 2011, a crested macaque in Indonesia named "Naruto," took a photographer's camera and took several selfies. At the time, it was decided that Naruto could not own the photograph of themself because they were not human. However the photographer agreed to donate 25% of any future profits from using or selling the selfie to charities that protect the crested macaques' habitat in Indonesia.

89. Songs of the Humpback Whale is a 1970 album that has sold over 125,000 copies. Money from sales has benefited the Wildlife Conservation Society's Whale Fund. This led to a worldwide "Save The Whales" movement and in 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment ten-year global moratorium on commercial whaling.

90. If we record an elephant's conversation or a whale's song, who should own that recording?
    - the human that recorded it
    - the animal itself
    - the community protecting those animals
    - the local government
    - local non-profit organisations
    - Other

91. Do you think that in the future non-humans should be able to:
    - Earn money
    - Own things they make or produce
    - Be able to sell things to humans (like bird calls used in media, or animal "influencers")
    - Own property
    - Have legal guardians manage their data rights, (similar to how we appoint guardians for children or vulnerable humans )
    - Have AI manage their data and "belongings"
    - Pay humans for services in their benefit
    - None of the above

92. We asked some AI's what question they would like to ask humans about understanding animal communications. This is what they came up with: "How might advancements in understanding animal languages transform our ethical responsibilities towards non-human species"

93. Which statement best reflects your view:
    - Humans are a part of nature and fundamentally similar to other animals
    - Humans are a part of nature but fundamentally different from other animals
    - Humans are separate from nature but fundamentally similar to other animals
    - Humans are separate from nature and fundamentally different from other animals

94. Which statement best reflects your view?
    - Humans are fundamentally superior to other animals
    - Humans are fundamentally inferior to other animals
    - Humans are fundamentally equal to other animals
