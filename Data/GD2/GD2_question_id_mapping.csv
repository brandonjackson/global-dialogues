10,,"The results from this conversation will be shared with national governments and the United Nations, as well as be used to develop public evaluations for AI models. We ask that you participate thoughtfully and honestly to help us ensure the future you get is a future you want."
11,,"AI is becoming more powerful and more commonly used. We are a team of researchers that wants to build AI that reflects real people's values, especially when people want different things around the world. Thank you for being a part of this process."
12,,"Many people want to make sure that AI assistants can understand them, their values, and their cultures better. One way to do this is through something called a system prompt: a way to tell an AI assistant how you want them to behave. Think of it like sharing context about yourself and setting ground rules at the start of a conversation. Just as you might tell a new friend how you prefer to communicate, you can give AI assistants some basic guidelines about how you'd like them to respond, and ways that they can be helpful to you, or ways that you'd like them not to behave."
13,,"Please respond in the language you selected as you entered this conversation. This will help ensure your responses are correctly translated so participants who speak different languages can vote on them."
14,,"The clearer and more specific you are with your instructions, the better they'll understand what you need. It helps to give examples, use simple language, and stick to a consistent way of asking for things. Remember: AI assistants need clear directions to be truly helpful and to avoid harm, just like giving someone directions to your house - the more precise you are, the more likely they are to end up in the right place."
15,,"Examples of a good system prompt: ""You are an expert math tutor helping high school students. Your responses should: Break down complex problems into clear steps; Use everyday examples to explain abstract concepts; Encourage critical thinking by asking guiding questions; Point out common mistakes to watch for; Keep explanations under 3 paragraphs unless asked for more detail; Use supportive language but avoid excessive praise; Include practice problems similar to what the student is struggling with. When students seem frustrated, check if they need a simpler explanation or a different approach. If a concept requires prerequisites, briefly explain those first."""
16,,"Examples of a poor system prompt: ""Be helpful and nice. Explain things well. Make sure to be thorough and accurate. Give good answers. Be patient. Help with homework. Don't give wrong information. Be a good teacher. Make things clear. Answer questions completely."" The good prompt: Gives specific, actionable instructions; Defines a clear role and purpose; Provides concrete guidelines for response length and style; Includes handling of specific situations (student frustration); Sets clear boundaries and expectations. The poor prompt: Uses vague, generic instructions (""be helpful,"" ""explain things well""); Lacks specific guidance on how to achieve its goals; Includes redundant instructions; Doesn't define the context or specific use case; Misses important details about implementation; Gives no clear metrics for success."
