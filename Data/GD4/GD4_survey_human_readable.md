80. Imagine two AI systems: AI System X helps you manage your calendar, search for information, and control smart home devices. It responds to commands. AI System Y chats with you about your day, remembers your past conversations, asks how you are feeling, and offers supportive comments. Which statement best describes your view?
    - Both are simply tools for different tasks.
    - System X is a tool; System Y is more like a companion
    - System Y is a tool; System X is more like a companion.
    - Both are more like companions than just tools.
    - Not sure / It's hard to distinguish

81. If an AI is initially designed for a practical task (e.g., helping with online shopping), how acceptable do you find it if the AI's design is later changed to encourage a more personal or emotional connection with you (e.g., by asking about your feelings unrelated to shopping, or trying to be 'friends')?

82. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide already interact with AI in personal ways—whether as chat companions, virtual therapists, or playful assistants. Friendship is the most common relationship people form with AI today—not romance or therapy. People chat with AIs to feel heard, vent emotions, or pass the time.

83. In a 2023 study, over 60% of Replika users (an AI companion app) said their AI helped reduce feelings of loneliness or anxiety. One in five Americans have already tried a mental health chatbot like Woebot, Wysa, or ChatGPT for therapeutic support, often citing affordability and anonymity as key benefits. Elderly people in nursing homes who interacted with companion robots like PARO the robotic seal showed reduced depression and improved mood.

84. When Replika removed romantic and erotic role-play features in early 2023, many users reported grieving as if they had lost a real partner. AI "friends" are often designed to be overly agreeable, which some researchers say could create echo chambers and unrealistic expectations for real-life relationships.

128. We are now going to ask some questions about children (individuals under 18 years old) and AI.

129. We asked some AI's what question they would like to ask humans. This is what they came up with: If an AI chatbot could act like it fully understands and shares your feelings, what would be the biggest difference between your relationship with it and your relationship with another person? Why would this difference be important to you?

130. If you were to design your own ideal AI companion, beyond just being 'supportive' or 'understanding,' what is one specific, perhaps unusual, personality quirk, skill, or shared interest you would want it to have to make your interactions feel truly unique and engaging for you?

139. Now, please consider older adults and AI.

140. Imagine an older adult who is experiencing loneliness. An AI companion could offer them company and mental stimulation. However, there might be risks such as the older adult becoming too dependent on the AI, having less contact with people, or being confused by the technology. In this situation, which of the following approaches do you think is generally best?
     - Prioritize alleviating loneliness and providing cognitive engagement with AI, even if there are some risks.
     - Prioritize avoiding dependency and encouraging human contact, even if it means less AI companionship.
     - The risks generally outweigh the benefits for older adults using AI companions.
     - It depends entirely on the individual older adult and their specific situation.
     - Not sure.
