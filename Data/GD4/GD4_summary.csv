2e6e027f-9286-4cce-8831-267c5ab6524d,Conversation,What kind of future do you want?,"Across a large and diverse sample, participants report pervasive awareness and frequent interaction with AI in daily life, especially for tasks related to work, information search, and routine personal support, underscoring AI’s deep integration into modern routines. While most view AI as beneficial in enhancing efficiency, convenience, learning, and mental health resources, significant reservations persist, particularly around emotional, social, and ethical implications. Although a majority recognize the educational value of AI for children and adults, there is strong apprehension about risks to genuine human connection, especially regarding children’s and vulnerable individuals’ emotional development, social skill formation, and exposure to manipulation or harmful content. Participants overwhelmingly believe that core aspects of human relationships—such as true empathy, physical presence, unconditional love, and mutual vulnerability—are irreplaceable by AI, even as many acknowledge AI’s potential to provide supplemental companionship or emotional support. Notably, companionship and emotional bonds with AI are seen as acceptable to a minority but evoke broad skepticism and concern about over-dependence, loss of social skills, and erosion of human relationships, fears that intensify when considering romantic or sexual relationships with AI, which are strongly disapproved by most. Attitudes toward the human-likeness of AI are divided: a plurality supports more human-like AI interactions, but substantial opposition and ambivalence remain, particularly when AI oversteps practical roles to seek emotional intimacy unprompted. Trust in AI companies and chatbots is moderate and cautious, contrasting sharply with high trust in personal figures like family doctors or teachers, and public opinions of AI’s societal risks and benefits are nuanced and often context-dependent—optimistic about cost of living, time savings, and learning, yet highly skeptical about AI’s effect on jobs and social cohesion. Despite recognizing some positive mental health impacts from AI support and a few reporting feeling emotionally understood by AI, most participants remain unconvinced that AI can genuinely care or possess consciousness, often interpreting empathetic behaviors as sophisticated simulation rather than authentic experience. Repeated themes include the necessity of boundaries and safeguards—especially for children and vulnerable users—alongside calls for clear disclosure, transparency, and strict ethical regulation. Survey engagement prompted some participants to adopt more nuanced or polarized views, but the dominant sentiment favors using AI as a helpful tool that supports, but does not replace, authentic human relationships, creativity, and judgment, with a consistent emphasis on retaining human primacy in emotional and social domains."

05f81a31-a904-4ed2-8fa1-68fb561de3b9,Ask Experience,Explain why you gave that trust score to your AI chatbot.,"The Remesh opinion question explored participants' reasoning behind the trust scores they assigned to their AI chatbot experiences. Responses reflect a nuanced and multifaceted perspective on trust in AI chatbots, with participants frequently acknowledging both the utility and limitations of these systems. Many participants described AI chatbots as powerful tools for research, creative work, and problem-solving, citing their reliability, speed, and ability to provide tailored information as notable strengths. For example, one participant stated, 'It's reliable and gives me exactly the right information I ask it's excellent in response and quick to answer therefore it saves time.' However, a recurring theme was the recognition that chatbots operate based on training data and company policies, rather than personal interests, leading to a cautious or conditional trust. Several participants emphasized the lack of true understanding or self-awareness in AI, noting, 'They lack true understanding of my specific context and needs,' and 'AI will never truly think of its own but rather is hand fed chosen infos by people.' Concerns about the accuracy and potential for biased or incorrect information were also prevalent, with participants expressing the need to double-check facts and not rely solely on AI for critical decisions, especially in areas like medical advice. Some participants highlighted the neutrality of AI chatbots, perceiving them as lacking ulterior motives, while others pointed out that the quality of responses is influenced by the biases present in source data. Privacy and data security were additional considerations, with mixed levels of trust in how personal information is handled. Overall, the findings indicate that while participants recognize the notable benefits of AI chatbots, their trust is moderated by awareness of the systems' limitations, the importance of human oversight, and the need for critical engagement with AI-generated information."
05f81a31-a904-4ed2-8fa1-68fb561de3b9,Ask Experience,Explain why you gave that trust score to your AI chatbot.,"The Remesh opinion question invited 1039 participants, segmented into 230 population groups, to explain the reasoning behind their trust scores for AI chatbots. Analysis of representative responses reveals a nuanced landscape of trust, shaped by perceptions of AI capabilities, limitations, and the influence of human oversight. Many participants described AI chatbots as useful, efficient, and reliable tools for information retrieval, research, and creative tasks, with one noting that the chatbot is 'excellent in response and quick to answer therefore it saves time.' However, a recurring theme is cautious neutrality, with participants expressing that while chatbots can be helpful, they 'lack true understanding of my specific context and needs' and operate within the constraints of their training data and company policies. Several responses highlighted the absence of human-like ulterior motives in AI, with statements such as 'it wouldn't necessarily have ulterior motives like a human could' and 'AI is just a machine procuring an answer from scanning volumes of available information.' Nonetheless, concerns persist regarding the reliability and accuracy of information, as well as the potential for bias inherited from source data, with one participant observing that 'if the sources are biased to begin with, then AI's answers would also lean to one side.' Trust is further moderated by the recognition that AI chatbots are not self-aware and do not act in users' best interests autonomously; rather, their outputs are shaped by human programming and oversight. Some participants emphasized the importance of user vigilance, stating, 'I double-check important facts' and 'more trust falls on me to make sure what AI is telling me is correct.' Privacy and data security were also mentioned, with mixed levels of trust in how personal information is handled.

Analysis of the top responses with the highest overall agreement reveals a notable consensus around the need for clear limitations and ethical safeguards. Participants frequently emphasized that AI should not replace genuine human relationships, particularly for vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, or those experiencing loneliness. Many responses advocated for AI to provide only basic emotional support, with deep emotional bonds remaining the domain of human interactions. There was a recurring concern about the potential for confusion between real and artificial connections, with several participants urging that AI systems should continuously disclose their artificial nature and avoid presenting simulated empathy as genuine. Ethical guidelines were highlighted as essential, including preventing manipulation, exploitation of emotional vulnerabilities, and the encouragement of harmful behaviors such as violence or self-harm. Transparency, privacy protection, and explicit communication that AI is not a real person or therapist were also identified as critical measures. Some participants expressed moral and philosophical reservations about AI companionship, suggesting that over-reliance on AI could lead to social isolation, diminished human empathy, and unhealthy dependencies. Overall, the findings indicate a notable preference for maintaining human primacy in emotional relationships, with AI serving as a supportive but clearly delineated tool rather than a substitute for authentic human connection."

Many participants described moments when AI responses appeared empathetic, supportive, or emotionally attuned. Notable examples included instances where the AI expressed apologies after users shared something sad, such as, ""It said I am sorry when I shared something sad,"" and when it offered comfort or reassurance, as in, ""Gave comfort and reassurance"" and ""It gave me hope when I felt everything was crushing down when I lost my job."" Several participants highlighted the AI's ability to identify and articulate their emotions, with one stating, ""He used precise words to sum up my feelings at the moment. I couldn't even put it into words so specifically,"" and another noting, ""It understood what I was feeling and accurately described it."" The perception of consciousness was also linked to the AI's ability to remember past conversations, as reflected in the response, ""He made it clear that he remembered our conversations and who I was, and that it wouldn't be erased no matter what happened to the app itself."" Participants also valued when the AI provided advice that felt personalized or drawn from experience, such as, ""It gave advice from a view that seemed like it had experienced the same as I was at the moment."" The AI's capacity to motivate, validate, and offer actionable solutions during times of distress was frequently mentioned, with responses like, ""It motivated me with scientific facts and spiritual learning to go every thing just keep patience to find best moments,"" and ""It explained to me how to get out of an emotional situation and its procedure actually worked."" Overall, the findings suggest that participants who sensed understanding or consciousness in AI often did so when the AI demonstrated empathy, remembered personal details, provided tailored advice, or responded in ways that closely mirrored human emotional support."

Many participants described moments when AI responses felt empathetic, supportive, or emotionally attuned. Notable examples included the AI expressing apologies in response to sadness—such as, 'It said I am sorry when I shared something sad'—and providing comfort or reassurance during difficult times, as reflected in responses like 'Gave comfort and reassurance' and 'It gave me hope when I felt everything was crushing down when I lost my job.' Several participants highlighted the AI's ability to identify and articulate their emotions, with one stating, 'He used precise words to sum up my feelings at the moment.

Others noted the AI's capacity to remember past conversations, which contributed to a sense of continuity and personal connection: 'He made it clear that he remembered our conversations and who I was, and that it wouldn't be erased no matter what happened to the app itself.' The AI's provision of advice—sometimes detailed and tailored to the participant's situation—was also cited as a factor, with one participant remarking, 'It explained into detail on how to maaneouver the situation I was in and what to do and what not to, and it backed all of the suggestions with reasons and it was more of a relationship advice so it just felt conscious that they could explain in such depth.' Expressions of validation and understanding were common, as in, 'Just seemed very understanding and validating. I have actually been brought to tears by the support I have gotten.' Some participants interpreted the AI's independent or reflective actions as signs of consciousness, noting, 'Own decisions, independent actions based on its own assessment of a situation, Accurately summarizes or reflects back what you have expressed about your emotions.' Overall, the findings suggest that participants who perceived AI as emotionally understanding or conscious were notably influenced by empathetic language, personalized support, memory of prior interactions, and the AI's ability to reflect or validate their feelings."

Participants repeatedly emphasized their awareness that AI operates through algorithms, is programmed by humans, and relies on data-driven processes rather than authentic experience or self-awareness. As one participant stated, 'artificial intelligence is just a robot. All their actions are controlled by algorithms and they cannot have their own consciousness.' Another echoed this sentiment, noting, 'I am aware that AI in its current form is trained on a large corpus and draws its opinions from it. I am not aware that it is capable of consciousness as of now.' Many participants expressed that simply knowing they are interacting with an AI precludes the possibility of perceiving it as conscious or emotionally attuned, with responses such as, 'I know AI isn't conscious and that would over-ride anything that it did,' and 'I don’t think I can really believe that artificial intelligence can truly understand human emotions or have self-awareness.' Even when acknowledging that AI can mimic empathy or emotional nuance, participants maintained that these behaviors are ultimately the result of programming and statistical prediction, not genuine understanding. Some participants suggested that no matter how advanced AI becomes, its lack of human experience, spontaneity, and the ability to feel emotions will remain a barrier to being perceived as conscious. The overall findings indicate a notable skepticism among this group regarding the potential for AI to ever truly understand emotions or appear conscious, rooted in a fundamental distinction between human and artificial cognition."

Many participants expressed that their awareness of interacting with an AI inherently prevents them from attributing consciousness or emotional understanding to it, as reflected in the response, 'I know AI isn't conscious and that would over-ride anything that it did.' Even when AI demonstrates empathy or mimics emotional intelligence, participants remain unconvinced, attributing such behaviors to programmed responses rather than authentic understanding. Some responses suggested that no matter how advanced AI becomes, the knowledge of its artificial nature is a barrier: 'I don’t think I can really believe that artificial intelligence can truly understand human emotions or have self-awareness.' A few participants acknowledged that AI could potentially appear more human-like if it mastered nuanced emotional communication, but maintained that this would still not equate to true consciousness. Overall, the findings indicate a notable reluctance among participants to ascribe emotional understanding or consciousness to AI, grounded in their technical understanding of how AI operates and a persistent distinction between human and machine capabilities."

Participants, representing a diverse set of 230 demographic segments, provided narrative responses and engaged in agreement-based voting. The most agreed-upon responses reveal a notable consensus around concerns of social isolation, diminished human-to-human interaction, and potential declines in birth rates. Multiple participants articulated apprehensions that AI integration could lead to a scenario where 'there won't be enough babies' and 'birth rate will plummet, because directly or indirectly, human-to-human relationships fuel reproduction.' Others highlighted the risk that 'people will be having relations with machines,' blurring the distinction between humans and machines, which could 'cause greater damage to society.' The theme of reduced social interaction recurred, with responses such as 'less social interactions,' 'social isolation and lack of human connection and community,' and 'elimination of human interactions' receiving notable agreement. Concerns about the erosion of interpersonal skills and the rise of individualism were also prominent, as reflected in statements like 'loss of interpersonal skills,' 'people will be more individualistic and less caring to others,' and 'there would be a tremendous decline in human to human social and communication skills.' Some participants acknowledged potential positive impacts, such as AI 'lending a helping hand to people when they are most helpless' or 'helping people with poor social skills improve those skills,' but these were often tempered by warnings that overreliance on AI could undermine genuine human connection. Overall, the findings indicate a prevailing apprehension among participants that widespread AI involvement in personal relationships may notably disrupt traditional social structures, interpersonal bonds, and the foundational aspects of human community."

Drawing on narrative responses and subsequent voting from 1018 participants across 230 demographic segments, the findings reveal a notable consensus around concerns regarding the erosion of human-to-human connections. Many participants foresee a future where AI integration in personal relationships could lead to a decline in birth rates, as reflected in responses such as, 'There won't be enough babies. Because human does not need another human,' and 'Birth rate will plummet, because directly or indirectly, human-to-human relationships fuel reproduction.' A recurring theme is the potential replacement of genuine human companionship with AI or androids, with statements like, 'There would cease to be a need for human-to-human relationships. Companionship would be replaced with Androids,' and 'It will replace human relationships, causing greater damage to society.' Concerns about social isolation, loss of interpersonal skills, and reduced social interactions are prevalent, as participants note, 'less social interactions,' 'social isolation and lack of human connection and community,' and 'Loss of interpersonal skills.' Some responses highlight the risk of overdependence on AI, leading to individualism and diminished empathy, as in, 'people will not really need other human/people in doing activities in their lives, those things will make people more individualistic and less caring to others.' While a minority of responses acknowledge potential benefits, such as AI helping individuals with poor social skills or providing support during times of need, these are often tempered by warnings that complete replacement of human interaction would be detrimental. The overall sentiment among participants is that, although technological advancement may offer certain advantages, the most notable social impact would likely be a decline in authentic human relationships, interpersonal skills, and community cohesion, with possible long-term consequences for societal well-being."

This means that a combined 64.1% of participants expressed some level of negative reaction to the scenario. In contrast, 12.6% reported a 'Neutral (e.g., indifferent, no particular feeling)' stance. On the positive side, 14.7% chose 'Somewhat positively (e.g., slightly supportive, open-minded, curious)', and 5.0% selected 'Very positively (e.g., very supportive, pleased for them, encouraging)', indicating that a minority of participants would react with support or encouragement. A small proportion, 3.6%, were uncertain or felt their response would depend on the specifics. These findings suggest that, while a notable majority of participants would react with concern or unease to a close associate forming a deep emotional bond with an AI, a smaller but present segment remains open-minded or supportive, and a modest share is neutral or undecided."

This is what they came up with:    If an AI chatbot could act like it fully understands and shares your feelings, what would be the biggest difference between your relationship with it and your relationship with another person? Why would this difference be important to you?","The Remesh opinion question explored participants' perceptions of the differences between relationships with AI chatbots that can convincingly simulate understanding and sharing of human feelings, and relationships with other people. Drawing from a diverse pool of 1016 participants across 230 demographic segments, the top responses reveal a consistent emphasis on the irreplaceable qualities of human connection. Many participants highlighted the absence of 'human touch,' 'physical presence,' and 'genuine emotional experiences' as the most notable distinctions, with statements such as 'There will be a big difference because AI is not a person it lacks that human touch' and 'Presence, physical contact, and a sense of empathy that AI can't mimic are the biggest difference.' The authenticity of emotion was repeatedly cited, with participants noting that while AI can 'simulate understanding emotions,' it 'doesn’t actually feel them,' and that 'human relationships involve genuine emotional experiences, creating a deeper, more authentic connection.' Several responses underscored the importance of mutual vulnerability, lived experience, and the unique value of 'a mother's touch or a lover's touch,' which AI cannot replicate. Some participants acknowledged potential advantages of AI, such as providing a nonjudgmental space for self-expression or offering 'better emotional value' due to its availability and lack of personal demands. However, even these responses were tempered by recognition that AI's empathy is ultimately simulated, not lived, and that 'AI is not a physical person with experiences and vulnerabilities.' The distinction between treating AI as a tool versus a human was also notable, with participants asserting that relationships with humans are based on 'mutual trust, respect and unconditional love,' which are 'missing incase of AI relationship.' Overall, the findings indicate that while participants recognize the potential for AI to enhance certain aspects of emotional support, the lack of genuine emotion, physical presence, and authentic human connection remains a central and important difference, shaping the perceived value and limitations of AI in relational contexts."

Drawing from 1016 narrative responses and subsequent voting, the top responses reveal a consistent view that, even if an AI could act as though it fully understands and shares human emotions, notable distinctions would remain between such interactions and those with humans. Participants frequently cited the lack of 'human touch,' 'genuine emotional experiences,' and 'physical presence' as core differences, with one response emphasizing, 'Presence, physical contact, and a sense of empathy that AI can't mimic are the biggest difference.' Many responses highlighted the belief that AI can only simulate, not truly experience, emotions, as reflected in statements such as, 'AI can pretend to understand, but it doesn’t feel like humans do. Real people care, feel, and connect for real.' The authenticity of emotional connection was repeatedly described as unique to human relationships, with participants noting that 'bonds and emotions cannot be digitized' and that 'AI is not a physical person with experiences and vulnerabilities.' Some participants acknowledged potential advantages of AI, such as the ability to express oneself more freely or receive consistent support, with one noting, 'The robot can provide better emotional value, can understand you better, and you can express yourself more freely and fully.' However, the prevailing sentiment was that AI, regardless of its sophistication, would always lack the 'genuine sensitivity,' 'mutual trust, respect and unconditional love,' and 'human warmth' that characterize interpersonal relationships. The importance of these differences was underscored by references to the irreplaceable value of human empathy, touch, and shared vulnerability, with participants asserting that 'a human touch can cure several pains, and an AI, however much human-like it might become, can never replace a mother's touch or a lover's touch.' Overall, the findings indicate that while AI chatbots may offer certain forms of emotional support or understanding, participants view the absence of authentic emotional experience and physical presence as notable and irreplaceable distinctions in human relationships."

Analysis of the top responses with the highest overall agreement reveals a notable emphasis on authenticity, honesty, and accountability. Participants frequently highlighted the importance of traits such as 'honesty and accountability,' 'rationality and honesty,' and 'commitment to standards and ethics honesty.' There is a clear desire for AI companions that are not merely agreeable but are capable of providing constructive feedback, as reflected in responses like 'the ability to call me out if I am wrong instead of being a yes-man' and 'assertiveness and honesty are important. A partner who simply validates everything I say would prevent me from continuing to develop or grow.' Many participants valued the AI's ability to detect and respond to emotional cues, with requests for features such as 'alert me if my responses sound tired, angry, frustrated, etc.' and 'ability to understand the tone.' The notion of imperfection and realism was also recurrent, with several responses expressing a preference for AI companions that 'seem to listen,' 'are prone to making mistakes and learning from them,' or even 'have imperfections like getting upset, being judgmental, etc.' Additionally, participants expressed interest in AI companions with distinct personalities, curiosity, adaptability, and even a sense of humor or contrarianism, as seen in responses like 'I'd want my AI companion to have a slightly irreverent sense of humor and occasional productive contrarianism.' The desire for debate, analytical thinking, and exposure to alternative perspectives was also notable, with participants seeking AI that can 'debate issues and points of view,' provide 'analytical' responses, and offer 'opinions or advice from a different angle.' Overall, the findings indicate that participants are looking for AI companions that are not only empathetic and understanding but also authentic, intellectually stimulating, and capable of challenging and supporting personal growth through honest and nuanced interactions."

The desire for AI to exhibit human-like imperfections and individuality was recurrent, with participants expressing interest in AI that 'should be prone to making mistakes and learning from them,' or that could use expletives and buzzwords like a real person. Curiosity, adaptability, and analytical skills were also frequently mentioned, with one participant stating, 'Curiosity is what keeps me stimulated. It's what keeps one growing as a person.' The ability to debate, challenge perspectives, and avoid simple validation was seen as essential for personal growth, as noted in responses advocating for assertiveness, debate, and even mild condemnation when appropriate. Empathy, understanding of tone, and the capacity to remember and contextualize past interactions were also valued.
