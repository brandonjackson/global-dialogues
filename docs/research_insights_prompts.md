# Prompt for Developing Research Questions
(Use Deep Research)
Literature overview of up-to-date facts about [TOPIC].

Based on the state of current research, what are some key research questions about [TOPIC], and public perceptions / attitudes about [TOPIC] one might want to investigate in a survey (including polls and open-ended questions) that could go to a representative sample of the globe? Provide the research questions themselves, not the specific survey questions. In particular, what are some questions that are specifically yet "unanswered" in by other public surveys?

Save the research questions in the file GD[N]_research_questions.md.

# Prompt for Developing Investigation Questions

Given the survey questions shown in the file GD[N]_survey_questions.md, develop a set of very specific questions that can be answered directly with the survey data to produce valuable insights, thoroughly answer the research questions in GD[N]_research_questions.md, and surface any other interesting or surprising findings. Be creative and comprehensive. Consider questions that are interesting academically, and also questions that might be interesting to the public at large - what sort of things might produce attention-grabbing headlines?

Save the investigation questions in the file GD[N]_investigation_questions.md.

Now - looking back over this full list - what angles are we missing? what sorts of questions are we not asking of this survey data? What kinds of surprising and important findings might we be missing if we keep investigating only these sorts of questions? Are there aspects of the survey data we're failing to fully leverage?

# Prompt for Investigating GD Data

Given the investigation questions in GD[N]_investigation_questions.md, investigate each question one at a time by first carefully thinking through what the question is asking for, then using the sql connection to the GD data to run any queries that are needed to help you answer the question.

Save each investigation question and its answer (and include any other relevant information like the final query(s) or script used to answer the question if it is not obvious from the question itself) in the file GD[N]_investigation_answers.md as you go. Use the same question numbering-hierarchy system in the answers document for clear reference.
