# GD4 Investigation Key Findings Summary

This document consolidates the key findings from GD4_investigation_answers.md, maintaining the original numbering system for easy cross-reference.

## 1.1 Do the AI-Reliant have more hopes or more fears?

**Question:** One might assume heavy users are purely optimistic, but they may have more nuanced concerns because of their deeper experience.

**Key Findings:**
- 30.6% of participants are AI-Reliant (n=310 out of 1012)
- AI-Reliant users express hope-to-concern ratio of 1.24:1 (more hopes than fears)
- Non-Users show opposite pattern with 0.64:1 ratio (more fears than hopes)
- AI-Curious users (12.1%) are most optimistic with 1.47:1 ratio
- Statistical significance: χ² = 11.572, p = 0.0007

**Significance:** Contradicts initial hypothesis - familiarity correlates with optimism rather than concern.

## 1.2 How does reliance impact their view of the social fabric?
