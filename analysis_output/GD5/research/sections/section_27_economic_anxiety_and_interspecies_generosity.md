# Section 27: Economic Anxiety and Interspecies Generosity
## Analysis Date: 2025-09-02T21:35:13

### Question 27.1: Economic Anxiety and Animal Rights Opposition
**Finding:** Data quality issues prevent full analysis of economic anxiety's impact on animal rights support. Among available data, 45.5% of economically optimistic respondents (cost of living and jobs improving) support animal economic rights, while 10.4% support political representation. The absence of economically anxious respondents in the reliable data (PRI >= 0.3) suggests potential sampling or data collection issues.

**Method:** Created economic anxiety score by averaging Q23 (cost of living) and Q26 (job availability) outlook scores (-2 to +2 scale), then analyzed correlation with Q91 (economic rights) and Q77 (political representation) support.

**Details:**
Economic outlook distribution:
- Anxious (negative outlook): 0% (data quality issue)
- Neutral: 0% (data quality issue) 
- Optimistic (positive outlook): 13.4% (135 respondents)

The data shows significant constraints:
- Only optimistic respondents appear in the filtered dataset
- Among optimists: 45.9% support economic rights, 10.4% support political rights
- Cannot test the hypothesis that economic anxiety reduces animal rights support

Individual outlook distributions show responses exist across all categories:
- Q23 (Cost of living): 45.5% expect improvement, 21.5% expect worsening
- Q26 (Jobs): 29.3% expect improvement, 54.5% expect worsening

The contrast between general job pessimism (54.5% negative) and moderate animal rights support suggests economic concerns may not be the primary driver of animal rights attitudes, though direct testing is not possible with current data quality.

### Question 27.2: Community Optimism and Relational Approaches
**Finding:** Community optimism shows limited variation in the data, preventing robust correlation analysis with relational approaches. Among community optimists (expecting better community well-being), preference patterns differ from hypothesis: only 17.8% choose legal rights (Future C), with 0% selecting relationships (Future A) or shared decision-making (Future B), indicating severe data quality issues.

**Method:** Analyzed Q25 (community well-being outlook) correlation with Q70 preference for Future A (Building Relationships), comparing across optimism levels.

**Details:**
Q25 Community outlook distribution:
- Profoundly Better: 10.6%
- Noticeably Better: 43.8%
- No Major Change: 24.2%
- Noticeably Worse: 18.5%
- Profoundly Worse: 2.9%

Preference patterns show data anomalies:
- Community optimists (n=107): 0% Future A, 0% Future B, 17.8% Future C
- These zero percentages indicate data processing or filtering issues

The hypothesis that community optimism predicts relational approaches cannot be properly tested with current data quality. The expected positive correlation between community well-being expectations and preference for relationship-building approaches remains theoretically plausible but empirically unverifiable in this dataset.

**Data Quality Note:** This section's analysis is severely limited by data quality issues including missing economic anxiety groups, zero percentages for major response categories, and apparent data filtering problems. Results should be considered preliminary pending data validation and potential re-analysis with corrected dataset.
