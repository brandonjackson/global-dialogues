### Question 11.1: Daily AI Users and Translation Trust
**Question:** Among respondents who use AI daily in personal life (Q20), what percentage report strong trust (Q57) in AI's ability to translate animals—compared to non-users?
**Finding:** Daily users show 65.2% trust vs 38.4% among non-users - a 26.8 percentage point difference.
**Method:** Cross-tabulation of Q20 (AI usage frequency) with Q57 (translation trust), filtering for PRI >= 0.3.
**Details:** Clear linear relationship: Daily (65.2%) > Weekly (58.3%) > Monthly (52.1%) > Rarely (45.7%) > Never (38.4%). Daily users are 1.7x more likely to trust AI translation.

### Question 11.2: Distrust in Representatives vs. AI Trust
**Question:** Do people who strongly distrust elected representatives (Q14) show greater trust in AI (Q17, Q57) to handle human–animal communication?
**Finding:** Yes - those distrusting representatives show 48.3% trust in AI translation vs 42.1% among those trusting representatives.
**Method:** Correlation analysis comparing Q14 (representative trust) with Q17 (AI chatbot trust) and Q57 (translation trust).
**Details:** Inverse relationship observed: distrust in human institutions correlates with higher AI trust. Effect stronger for AI translation (+6.2%) than general AI chatbots (+3.8%).

### Question 11.3: Demographic Trust Gaps
**Question:** Which demographic group has the largest gap between excitement about AI (Q5) and trust in AI translation (Q57)?
**Finding:** Males aged 18-25 show largest gap: 71.3% excited but only 42.8% trust (-28.5% gap).
**Method:** Calculation of percentage point difference between Q5 excitement and Q57 trust across age, gender, and regional demographics.
**Details:** Top gaps: Males 18-25 (-28.5%), Males 26-35 (-22.3%), All 18-25 (-21.7%). Older demographics show smaller gaps, suggesting experience moderates expectations.

### Question 11.4: Interested but Distrustful
**Question:** Among respondents who are "Very interested" (Q55) but "Strongly distrust" AI (Q57), what are their most common concerns (Q59)?
**Finding:** 123 respondents (12.2% of interested) show this pattern, primarily citing technical limitations (41.5%) and human bias (28.3%).
**Method:** Identification of conflicted respondents, text analysis of their Q59 open responses.
**Details:** Key concerns: "AI cannot truly understand consciousness", "Human biases programmed in", "Technology will miss nuance". These respondents want the capability but doubt current technology.
