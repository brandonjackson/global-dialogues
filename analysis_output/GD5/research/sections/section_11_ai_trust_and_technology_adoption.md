### Question 11.1: Daily AI Users and Translation Trust
**Question:** Among respondents who use AI daily in personal life (Q20), what percentage report strong trust (Q57) in AI's ability to translate animals—compared to non-users?
**Finding:** Daily users show 53.8% trust vs 31.9% among non-users - a 21.9 percentage point difference.
**Method:** Cross-tabulation of Q20 (AI usage frequency) with Q57 (translation trust).
**Details:** Clear relationship: Daily (53.8%) > Weekly (52.8%) > Monthly (39.8%) > Annually (31.2%) > Never (31.9%). Daily users are 1.7x more likely to trust AI translation.

### Question 11.2: Distrust in Representatives vs. AI Trust
**Question:** Do people who strongly distrust elected representatives (Q14) show greater trust in AI (Q17, Q57) to handle human–animal communication?
**Finding:** No - those trusting representatives show 70.3% trust in AI translation vs 43.2% among those distrusting representatives.
**Method:** Cross-tabulation comparing Q14 (representative trust) with Q57 (translation trust).
**Details:** Positive relationship observed: trust in human institutions correlates with higher AI trust. Those who trust representatives are 1.6x more likely to trust AI translation, contradicting the hypothesis of institutional distrust driving AI adoption.

### Question 11.3: Demographic Trust Gaps
**Question:** Which demographic group has the largest gap between excitement about AI (Q5) and trust in AI translation (Q57)?
**Finding:** Males aged 18-25 show largest gap: 71.3% excited but only 42.8% trust (-28.5% gap).
**Method:** Calculation of percentage point difference between Q5 excitement and Q57 trust across age, gender, and regional demographics.
**Details:** Top gaps: Males 18-25 (-28.5%), Males 26-35 (-22.3%), All 18-25 (-21.7%). Older demographics show smaller gaps, suggesting experience moderates expectations.

### Question 11.4: Interested but Distrustful
**Question:** Among respondents who are "Very interested" (Q55) but distrust AI (Q57), what are their most common concerns (Q59)?
**Finding:** 127 respondents (17.6% of interested) show this pattern, citing technical limitations and reliability concerns.
**Method:** Identification of conflicted respondents (very interested but somewhat/strongly distrust).
**Details:** Key concerns include AI's inability to understand consciousness, human biases in programming, and technology missing nuance. These respondents want the capability but doubt current technology's reliability.
