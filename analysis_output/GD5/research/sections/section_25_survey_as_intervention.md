# Section 25: The Survey as an Intervention — Measuring Opinion Shifts
## Analysis Date: 2025-09-02T21:36:23

### Question 25.1: Belief Change Measurement
**Finding:** 67.9% of participants (682/1005) changed their belief category between initial (Q33) and final (Q94) responses, with the most common shift being from "Other" to "Superior" (47.9% of changes), suggesting the survey process crystallized previously ambiguous beliefs rather than fundamentally changing them.

**Method:** Comparison of categorized responses from Q33 (initial open-ended belief) to Q94 (final structured belief question) using keyword matching for categories.

**Details:** The high change rate is misleading as it primarily reflects movement from vague initial responses to clearer final positions. Key patterns:
- Other → Superior: 327 changes (47.9%)
- Other → Equal: 186 changes (27.3%)
- Superior → Equal: 72 changes (10.6%)
- Different → Superior: 28 changes (4.1%)

Most "changes" represent clarification rather than reversal - participants who gave ambiguous initial responses settled into definitive positions. True belief reversals (Superior → Equal or vice versa) account for only 12.5% of changes. The survey appears to function more as a belief clarification tool than a persuasion instrument.

### Question 25.2: Emotional Response and Mind Change
**Finding:** Contrary to hypothesis, mind-changers and non-changers showed nearly identical emotional profiles (Connected/Protective: 37.8% vs 38.7%) and mind-changers actually reported LESS impact from scientific facts (χ²=19.54, p=0.0006), suggesting belief changes were driven by reflection rather than emotional or factual persuasion.

**Method:** Chi-square analysis comparing Q44 (impact) and Q45 (emotions) responses between mind-changers (N=682) and non-changers (N=323).

**Details:** The counterintuitive findings reveal:
- Non-changers more likely to report "great deal" of impact from facts (29.1% vs 23.3%)
- Emotional responses virtually identical between groups:
  - Curious: 59.7% vs 60.1%
  - Connected: 32.3% vs 31.6%
  - Protective: 15.2% vs 16.1%

This pattern suggests belief changes occurred through cognitive processing rather than emotional engagement or factual impact. Those who maintained consistent beliefs paradoxically reported stronger reactions to the information, possibly because their existing beliefs were reinforced rather than challenged. The survey appears to prompt introspection that clarifies rather than converts beliefs.
