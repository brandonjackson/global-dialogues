**AI vs Human Trust in Wildlife Conflict Resolution by Country:**

India (n=183):
  - yes, because AI is not biased, its data driven , takes logical decision: 1 (0.5%)
  - yes I would trust AI to interpret animal communication more than humans because AI is capable of analyzing huge datasets and find patterns or sentiment analysis unlike humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - no, i would trust humans to interpret animal because of a reason of believe that there is an accountability and sort of trust that it is for betterment of human and wildlife conflicts. As human have many proactive groups to protect wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - less, becuase ai can't really feel anything, wheres human beings are complex creatures that have interacted with animals for a long time and understand emotions: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust more to ai rather going for humans 

: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust humans more than ai because ai lacks the nuance and heartfelt understanding that humans can provide: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust ai more because it interpret animal communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - i think ai and animals will not go as well as humans and animals cause of emotional capabilities: 1 (0.5%)
  - i don't fully trust on ai: 1 (0.5%)
  - because as a human we have to understand the feelings of animals as they cannot express themselves.: 1 (0.5%)
  - because AI is less prone to make mistake as humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - after reading above para maybe more , beacuse it is helpful

: 1 (0.5%)
  - You can trust that it will alert you: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes. Humans are rarely trustworthy.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, it will warn people in advance: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, humans should not destroy wildlife: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, because it saves both parties the animal kingdom & humans : 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, because ai could interpret better and would be able to resolve better: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I would somewhat trust AI to resolve a human wildlife conflict because this is something for which AI is one of the best solutions which minimizes the casualties caused due  to the same issue.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I trust ai to resolve communication between us: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I think ai would interpret communicate to animals better than humans obv. It depends on the purpose of use.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, AI enabled cameras are there definetely it will give some better inputs as compared to past. We can save ourselves as well as theirs. : 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes because over a period of time with proper advancements we can expect AI to be an intermediary between humans and animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes I would trust AI more than humans to interpret animals because I feel like humans might cheat more than AI when interpretation: 1 (0.5%)
  - Would trust ai here because it will be perfectly trained for the same: 1 (0.5%)
  - When it comes to deciphering animal communication in the context of resolving human-wildlife conflicts, I would have more trust in AI than I would humans. AI is capable of quickly analyzing large datasets, recognizing patterns in animal behavior, and offering early alerts with no emotional predisposition. AI can work with consistency and continuity that humans cannot and can lead to effective solutions to prevent conflict, thereby mitigating harm to both people and wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - We sould trust AI for complex work. If we train AI with better feeds or data then it'll do better work then any human.: 1 (0.5%)
  - We can make AI to behave in certain way also make AI to follow strict rules regarding safety and to mitigate risks. We can also easily monitor the behavior of AI. : 1 (0.5%)
  - Trust both equally as AI would give more precision data and human intelligence can make better decisions : 1 (0.5%)
  - To solve a himan wildlife conflict AI will be helpful as we will understand the situation and take actions accordingly : 1 (0.5%)
  - To save the crop from animals, AI can play an important role in saving crops as well as some danger may be avoided by use of AI technology in some danger because human can see animals in the camera and can understand the situation to save them from harmful animals ie lions,tigers etc.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Through careful planning, inclusive dialogue, and sustainable development practices, we can work  toward a future where infrastructure, agriculture, and mining projects contribute to, rather than detract from, the harmonious coexistence of people and wildlife: 1 (0.5%)
  - They interfere in with their life what they think about human I don't think these things are really matters.: 1 (0.5%)
  - The only problem is commercialization and loss of environmental habitats of animals. So human is responsible for this. It's better to work on this and return their home rather than making AI to work. AI is nowhere good. It's just like doing more bad. Why to resolve? Just return the homes of other species that's animals. Simple! : 1 (0.5%)
  - The given scenario was nice if it works. If AI could resolve the barrier/conflict it will be good for both humans and animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - The answer depends on the situation and place. If a mahout is there- he will communicate well to the elephant than AI, because he trained it, if you go for wildlife then it may be different scenario may AI perform well to communicate.: 1 (0.5%)
  - The Idea of resolving a wildlife conflict is great but do you really think the nature and the animals the way they are made and born they do have capacities to protect themselves and these artificial things which humans are doing in the name of development can interrupt their natural cycles and animals falls under for tests: 1 (0.5%)
  - The AI work properly, then I will definitely trust AI to resolve a human and wildlife communication. If the AI truly and accurately interpret the languages of animals. It will be good so that we can understand them better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Sometimes animal behavior is very different from other human beings : 1 (0.5%)
  - Not at all. Even today, when I used AI for, 3rd time only it gave a correct answer. Shamelessly, it gave the first wrong answer the first 2 times and continued with sorry for clarification, waiting, giving another chance etc. So, is there any difference when it comes to Animals? It's gonna be worse.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Nope it might result in more loss of lives on both ends: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I would want both AI and humans because both need at sometimes AI wont be getting the nature feels which human can help in and the AI can help them in making things easier for the humans to understand and make progress.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I would not trust. You see, first humans take away elephant corridors to build homes, and then complain about man-animal conflicts. The AI will be trained by humans only and I expect, humans to aid human's concerns, not the animals'; so a wrong interpretation, or a purposefully wrong interpretation could lead to havoc.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I don't trust AI to interpret animal communications to resolve a human wildlife conflict because of the reliability or accuracy of the interpretation done by AI. Wrong or misleading interpretation may lead to major consequences, making matters from bad to worse.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I don't think so we can fully rely on AI technology for interspecies communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - No comment as i don't trust them doing justice less or more: 1 (0.5%)
  - No because like I mentioned before AI can be inaccurate and misinterpret language and it may cause more confusions: 1 (0.5%)
  - No I wouldn't. Ai should only be used as assistant to humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No I can't trust it completely because there may be cases were the AI may misinterpret: 1 (0.5%)
  - More, as less ulterior motive and superior knowledge : 1 (0.5%)
  - More because it has a logical approach and no emotions.: 1 (0.5%)
  - More because AI can interpret without personal prejudice: 1 (0.5%)
  - Maybe I would still trust a scientist researching in the field more. AI is only a tool we turn to for help. I don't think there will be a day when I trust it a cent percent: 1 (0.5%)
  - Machines cannot be trusted for 100% translation and it doesn't sound like a good idea : 1 (0.5%)
  - Lyes i would. Because it will be efficient: 1 (0.5%)
  - Less. Or may be even equal to humans. Even if it interprets, resolution requires human involvement : 1 (0.5%)
  - Less actually. If they are tame animals like elephants, humans must know how to behave with them to calm them down: 1 (0.5%)
  - It's really change overall situation if ai alert before so animals and crops and human all are safe and we can protect them: 1 (0.5%)
  - It would be obvious that AI can communicate and interpret between human and wildlife because a i itself is trained by professional humans in their subject matter and I think it would not only resolve human wildlife conflict but will also bring a concern regarding humans who can misuse this: 1 (0.5%)
  - It will surely resolve human wildlife conflict because if we better understand animals better will be dealing with animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It varies, depending on the type of application for which i use AI, the trust also varies.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It is not about AI but who is using and who is controlling. If there are enough rules by government. How to use AI and with good regulations AI is helpful but who will check the rule and law. : 1 (0.5%)
  - It is a better option and trusted one because it saves life and avoids many bad situation among them: 1 (0.5%)
  - It is a 50-50 for me. For the collection and analysis of data, using AI can be helpful, but relying entirely on an AI system can be harmful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It help human and animals also its best and i trust the process: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends. AI can work in a great manner when it comes to tracking only a certain radius and warning humans about incoming troops of animals. However, if we're dependent solely on AI, I think AI will somewhat be biased to help humans more and neglect animals to an extent. Humans have trained the models, not animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends upon the condition and I think somewhere ,somewhat AI can resolve the conflict issue,as it is in some cases more accurate and can be useful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends on who the human invigilator is. If the person belongs to animal right organizations, i would trust the human more than AI, otherwise not.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends on how well it is developed as there are two sided coins here both elephants and humans, and if the ai isn't properly developed it can lead to a disaster between them so if the ai is tested well it can be trusted or else nope.: 1 (0.5%)
  - In this scenario, it will be helpful for both farmers and animals. there will be lesser conflicts, so harm to both will be very less.: 1 (0.5%)
  - In case of understanding emotions, i prefer Humans are better than AIm: 1 (0.5%)
  - If the AI systems can interpret the messages well, then I would trust them. : 1 (0.5%)
  - If that happens it is good for every human and animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - If programmed correctly or ethically than AI can be proven better than humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - If it means avoiding conflict and it is just a warning system, it would help protect animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - If a person is trained to understand animals, I would 100% choose him/her. But if there is no trained person, then I can trust AI so that no harm is occurred.: 1 (0.5%)
  - IF AI CAN COMPLETELY INTERPRET ANIMAL COMMUNICATION THEN WE CAN TRUST AI. THE AI  MAY NOT INTERPRET COMPLETELY ,WHICH MAY CAUSE MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I'm not sure which is more effective.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust the ai as it relies on research and understanding: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust more about AI technology as it is reliable and communication made with animals will surely help community. There will not be personal conflicts and resolution will be in favour of both animals and humans : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust it less. AI just simply can't be trusted. It's literally just an amalgamation of a lot of numbers and facts. It cannot act in my best interest because it can never fully encapsulate the complexity of being human and decision making.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust it if I knew the model had been trained enough and how it's working. We can't trust AI at the initial stages to just go out there and resolve a major conflict.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans to interpret : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more to interpret animal communication as humans are able to instill a sense of love and kindness behind their actions, which might not be possible when an AI would be used.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more than AI to understand animals. Human have lived with animals from eons and understand them much better than a soulless entity getting it's information from data storages. Humans can see and feel what an animal is going through and what they trying to communicate based on our past experiences. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more as they have a stronger grasp on emotions while AI is a machine.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust ai more in interpret animal comunication because humans can't communicate with animals without help of ai: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust a human more since humans and elephants have had a good standing relationship for a long time : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust a AI same as a human: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI to interpret a possible human-animal conflict, only if it produces unbiased and effective results.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI to do better to interpret animal communication so that we could help Animals in need: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in resolving human-wildlife conflicts, mainly because AI can process vast amounts of data quickly and detect patterns humans might miss. Unlike humans, AI can remain objective and consistent, which is important in sensitive situations. However, I’d still want human oversight to ensure cultural and ecological factors are considered.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI since AI can have millions of historical data / behavioural data to understand animals better. Moreover, all these years where humans have been understanding the animals, their life haven't changed for any better. So, this time for AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI over humans to interpret animal communication to resolve a human-wildlife conflict because AI would be able to decode signals that humans cannot.  There would be no bias from AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans since AI is not emotional like humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans in this specific scenario, but with safeguards. AI can process patterns impartially (e.g., elephant movement data) without emotional bias, and systems like camera alerts already reduce conflicts. However, human oversight is still needed to ensure AI doesn’t ignore contextual nuances or unintended consequences—like disrupting elephant migration routes. The ideal approach would combine AI’s efficiency with ethologists’ expertise.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more in this case. Humans can talk like humans. But AI can mimic animals' voices, making it far more realistic.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more if it is developed by a reputed company known for high standards: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more because it is unbiased unlike humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more because it can quickly interpret data. I don't think humans understamd animals that much or might be impatient with it and worry about their own selfish motives. It is better to have AI as a neutral and unbiased interpreter of the sounds and behavior of animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as long as it is programmed ethically and is not harmful to animals.  : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as it is more efficient since it doesn't require rest as human does, but we should make sure that no 3rd party have access to the system or else it can be manipulated.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as it does not have emotions or any intents of personal gains: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans are AI is programmed by human only. So AI will only shows those results which are already programmed in it

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI less as mostly AI uses a set of data to learn things which is mostly provided by humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in this regard as human do not know how to interpret the elephant language: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in terms of help in communicating with the animals and we can know how they feel when they are hurt.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in such cases as it may benefit humans and doesn't cause direct harm to animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI a little more in such cases, especially when it comes to early detection and accurate warning. AI can quickly gather data from cameras and sensors to determine if elephants are approaching farms, and take immediate action, which humans may not be able to do with such rapid and constant monitoring. Also, AI can understand elephant movements and behavior better by recognizing repeated patterns.

However, I would be a little cautious when it comes to communicating directly with elephants.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would support AI more in such a scenario, as long as it only relays information to the humans, but does not step in as a mediator 

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would somewhat trust AI more than humans to interpret animal communication in conflict situations because it can process large amounts of data quickly, detect subtle patterns, and respond consistently without emotional bias or fear. However, I’d still be cautious that AI is built by humans, and its priorities might reflect human-centered goals rather than what's best for animals. There’s a risk it could be used to control or manipulate rather than truly understand and coexist.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would not trust ai more than the humans to interpret animal communications. Ai feeds on the data provided where as we as humans can feel the emotions of the animals : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would not trust AI more than humans to interpret animal. I would use AI during absence of skilled human communicator: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would never trust ai in this.  Because, people need to know ai does not have empathy, it's a great deal riskier to trust people as it is, so it's better to resolve any conflicts by considering the wellfare of both animals and humans. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would definitely trust AI in some situations but if its a human who has widely studied the animal's behaviour he would be able to take a better approach in resolving conflicts. Compared to the average human, AI would be better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I won’t fully trust an ai unless there’s also a person working with ai.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I wont trust AI completely or more. An AI's program can be changed or easily manipulated. If there is a company or group of individuals who can benefit from these human-wildlife conflict and if they can use this AI to make things worse, it would be bad idea.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I won't trust anyone unless I get better knowledge : 1 (0.5%)
  - I will trust it more because AI can understand the needs of wild animals, what are their needs, what are the problems of their families, AI will be useful for understanding all this.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I will trust AI more as humans can often change their mind to fulfill their narrow self interest but an AI won't do that.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I will never trust AI because its usage in any way could be dangerous for human and for animal as well .: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust more on AI than human because human are more cruel now a days.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust in AI, because some humans can understand or interpret the animals' language and their routine. I think it will help to make AI better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust humans more as they have good communication developed as a part of nature, and the solutions that are developed are from the ability of mankind and nature.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust human more as ai could make mistskes: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust ai more to interpret animal communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI, but humans still cannot communicate with animals effectively: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more. In India there is many cases of human wildlife conflict. AI will help creating warning systems, maybe not communictaing system but some devices we can use for diverting animals from farms. And lead them further in forset or in their habitat: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more, as humans can be aggressive while AI can act in controlled manner: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more to interpret animal communication because it won't be biased and it is more intelligent to interpret.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more than humans in terms of interpretation, because AI is more advanced than humans and, unlike humans, can analyze millions of possibilities simultaneously.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more because it helps humans and they can already know what kind of activities they are doing: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more as it has lesser bias: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI if its truly gives the positive results.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI if it warn people about elephant roaming near crops. It will help to reduce the damange.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI don't have any bias like human beings and trust the AI : 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI a bit more as it can process many sounds and patterns quickly, but it still needs human help to understand feelings and nature better. So, both should work together.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think, in this case, an AI system would be very helpful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think they are the same. AI exists from human input. I'd rather trust someone who can speak from instinct and presence than pre-programmed responses. That is, a human would be a better bet. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I think it should be a mix of human and AI interpretation. AI may play a vital role in evolving human interpretation of animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think it depends on how to communication is done, is it only verbal or physical as well. I think verbal communication if done using AI in non harmful way can be trusted but needs to be see n how it will be done, how will the training process be will it follows nature's rules?: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think I would trust AI to some extent to resolve a human-wildlife conflict because it would save many lives of animals as well as humans. It would let the animals live a peaceful life.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think I can trust AI more than Humans but not like that as it can harm animals badly in many ways.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think Ai would be a good option: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think AI can't understand feelings: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think AI can better interpret animals because although human has made AI but AI is far better than human thinking.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I somewhat trust AI more than humans. Because humans can interpret communication for their own benefit while AI can't : 1 (0.5%)
  - I preferably not fully trust the AI because animal commnication should be different because of their culture.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I guess somehow I trust human more but this technology is good for future : 1 (0.5%)
  - I feel AI can interpret the animals well than humans. It would be safe to use AI to understand animals without taking risk of attack from animals to understand them. AI help us to protect our surrounding by understanding the animals preferences. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I dont think the use of AI in this situation is necessary as it may be emotional situation and it should be resolved by human for the given conflict as AI can’t interpret accurately during a communication and it may lead to a more danger situation : 1 (0.5%)
  - I don't trust AI so much because use of AI is less means no problem : 1 (0.5%)
  - I dmt think its a good idea to open the doors that nature has locked for us for so many reasons. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I cant say in which way AI could be used because there can be extreme worst and extreme good as well.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I can trust AI more because when someone can communicate with animals, why are they doing so with others? They can communicate with the same intensity to others so this can end the conflict between the humans and animals.

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I can not fully agree towards the fact  That Ai can be used for good purpose only. I think human intervention is must in case of these sensitive topics: 1 (0.5%)
  - I am not sure. With the humans mind when the helpful thing can turn into horror for someone

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I am not sure because countries with deeply advanced forensic aerial surveillance have been 'attacked' and their border barbed wire fences stormed by adversarial groups. So I am not sure if this would help wild animals and locals. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I agree to a limited scope that AI has a good shot in future to interpret the communication and help in some ways: 1 (0.5%)
  - Humans have sixth sense and animals dont, So I would trust AI to warn us about the animals near farms which would prevent crop loss or any accidents caused by the animals. So I would trust the AI in this way.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Honestly speaking, I personally am not quite in the favour of interpreting animal conversation by AI. Animals dont attack by themselves, they do so in order to protect themselves or their family. So no point of Human Wildlife Conflict.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Equally trust humans and AI as both have different strength and weakness: 1 (0.5%)
  - Depends on the AI's prior results, if it has a good track record then why not. If not then humans with experience is a better choice.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Because in the end they are just machines that can be manipulated by human beings and I don't trust human beings with lot of power : 1 (0.5%)
  - Bcz AI can process vast amounts of data like sounds, movements, and patterns consistently and without bias. It can detect subtle signals or trends that humans might miss due to limited attention or emotional involvement.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Automation is definitely needed where we need to reduce human animal conflicts especially in case of big therms like elephants. Why automation? because automation regular monitoring and at time reminders/alarms/triggers about animal activity and doing all that without human help could be really useful. And I think AI could bring that automation we need: 1 (0.5%)
  - Anyone’s judgement can be faulty there’s no right answer to it: 1 (0.5%)
  - Ai because its beyond human mind

: 1 (0.5%)
  - About the same. Trained professionals whether AI or human do have experience in dealing with these issues.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI's ability to process vast amounts of complex data without emotional biases, identify subtle patterns, and potentially learn the nuances of animal communication more objectively than humans could lead to more effective and less disruptive solutions, prioritizing the well-being of both humans and wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI will help both human beings and animals live in harmony without conflicts. I trust AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI may provide wrong answers : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI may be able to detect animal attack in advance. In that case a human and Anamal conflict can be avoided.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is technology and will have flaws and the experiment to learn animal language is absurd.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is suitable for human purposes and for animals they doesn't give consent about interpretation . : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is human operated any human with malicious intent can manipulate or mislead animal communication. So I don't want to trust neither human nor AI: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is human effort.I believe AI have advantages and disadvantages.If AI can work accurate that would be appropriatable.But some point if AI can't understand completely animals behaviour that would be wrong direction to make: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is a virtual thing and humans are real. I definitely trust humans more than AI because AI only acts on the prefed or inbuilt data that was recorded and integrated by humans only. So AI is dependent whereas humans not. Animals are not conflicting with humans, its human which is interfering in animal territories. If they stop doing so there will be no conflict at all which needs and AI solutions. : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI could be trusted more here because if AI system is trained properly with a large dataset of different animal signals and sounds which are interpreted correctly then it could be useful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI can have a large data set to make a better informed decision which only a few human may possess when communicating with an animal.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI can be a useful tool, but without human sensitivity and ethical judgements, it cannot provide sustainable solutions to wildlife conflicts. The trust must be on an AI + human partnership.: 1 (0.5%)
  - A little more because the technology could enable earning : 1 (0.5%)
  - 
In technical reliability, many may lean toward AI; in ethical, emotional, and interpretive trust, many still prefer experienced humans. The ideal future may involve collaboration AI tools supporting human insight rather than replacing it combining the speed and scale of machines with the wisdom and empathy of human understanding.: 1 (0.5%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 1.1%**

United States (n=151):
  - yes, because i feel they'll interpret it more better: 1 (0.7%)
  - yes sure because it might mostly get and interpret most animal sounds.: 1 (0.7%)
  - less so.. because AI is a tool that humans use but one that is more removed from humans than say their hands or voice. so there is less control. : 1 (0.7%)
  - id trust AI to communicate with animals over humans: 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust it less, because i'm not sure if it is able to correctly interpret the animals' intentions, while humans might have more experience with those. : 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust humans more because we can receive context clues to make more of an informed decision of the animals body language in addition to the communication we are trying to decode. : 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust AI more than humna because humans can be funny: 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust AI it will take good data: 1 (0.7%)
  - i will trust Ai more because it will be sincere and not biases: 1 (0.7%)
  - i will trust AI in interpreting animal communication to resolve human wildlife conflict because AI strength

AI can analyze data without emotional bias,potentially leading to more accurate interpretation

AI can process large account of data from varous sources

AI can apply consistent rules and frame works to interpret animal communication,reducing variability in interpretation: 1 (0.7%)
  - i believe Ai cant be bias except with human manipulations of codes and an AI system would mostly give accurate result except in cases there mistakes in codes : 1 (0.7%)
  - humans are much more sophisticated brain wise therefore for the human wildlife conflict a human angle will be much more appreciated : 1 (0.7%)
  - ai because i feel it would be less biased compared to humans: 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes, this is why, speed and consistency as AI can analyze and respond to animal communication in real time and consistently something humans might struggle with especially in dynamic and rapidly changing situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes, I would trust AI more than humans : 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes I suppose that would be a good use to it as it involves human intervention.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Why disturb the lives of wild animals? Wouldn’t it be better to give them some living space?: 1 (0.7%)
  - Why I’d Trust AI More Than Humans and But Human Judgment Is Still Necessary Because: 1 (0.7%)
  - What I can say is, I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in these situations but only if it's developed carefully and ethically.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Using AI to avoid harm between animals and humans will definitely be positive for both species. : 1 (0.7%)
  - The application of AI in solving human-wildlife conflicts would make me slightly more confident than humans, as it does not have the emotional bias to the vast amount of data and can notice the pattern that humans probably would not. Nonetheless, it must be under the management of a human being so as to make ethical and contextually adequate decisions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Probably ai to communicate with animals because you simply can communicate with animals.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Probably AI, they are more advanced and trained : 1 (0.7%)
  - Overall, I trust expert human more than AI more than average human in any area, including animal communication. I believe that AI can achieve a reasonable level of accuracy in human-wildlife conflict given enough data to dig out patterns.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Obviously I would trust AI more, since the track record of human communication with animals is abysmal (98% of the world isn't vegan, etc.).: 1 (0.7%)
  - None, both AI and humans are connected.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No. Communication is complex, and subtle nuances may not be detected by AI. Human experts on certain animal species, who can correctly recognize warning signs or hostility from animals, would be more reliable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No, humans has natural gift on how to communicate with other species : 1 (0.7%)
  - No the reason behind that is because the one programming the AI has no interaction with the animals compared to the human interpreter.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No i would trust Humans more to interprete animal language: 1 (0.7%)
  - Neutral. I can't tell who to trust more: 1 (0.7%)
  - Neither. I don't really trust either: 1 (0.7%)
  - More than humans because AI wouldn't have emotions effecting it's decisions: 1 (0.7%)
  - Maybe, if AI can talk to animals correctly, it could guide them to avoid conflict.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Maybe less because it is untested and unfamiliar.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Less than humans because AI lacks the complexity of thoughts: 1 (0.7%)
  - Less than human... An ai can never have human empathy or human senses which animals pick up on: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI slightly more than humans in resolving conflicts, but only when paired with ethical oversight and human insight. Combining both would lead to the most respectful and effective solutions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more to give fast, unbiased warnings, but humans still need to understand and respect animals deeply to truly solve the problem. 

: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more than humans—if rigorously validated—because it can analyze vast, subtle patterns in elephant calls objectively and at scale, warning farmers and even signaling elephants without human bias or delay. However, I’d insist on transparent methods and oversight to ensure its “translations” truly reflect elephant intentions rather than our assumptions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more than humans for interpreting and managing human-wildlife conflict communication, because AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, detect subtle patterns, and provide consistent, real-time warnings without human biases or fatigue. Humans might misinterpret signals or react emotionally, especially in stressful conflict situations, whereas AI systems can remain objective.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more because it can react faster and more could help prevent conflict before it happens: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more because it can notice tiny details that people might miss. AI doesn’t get tired or make guesses based on feelings. But I’d still want a person to check its work, just in case. Together, AI and humans could make better choices for both people and animals. That way, we use technology and kindness to keep everyone safe.: 1 (0.7%)
  - It depends on the human. AI is a trained model that can be predictable, while humans are variable and unpredictable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - In the example given, in Thailand, India and Tanzania, it never occurred to me that this would be a use for AI. This is a really interesting idea, and I think if humans are in charge of the research and projects, AI would definitely be a valued asset. I don't think AI should be used without human input, in this type of situation. : 1 (0.7%)
  - In order to decipher animal communication and settle disputes between people and nature, I would put more faith in AI than in humans.  AI can give objective data through technology like webcams to alert people and allow direct communication with elephants, reducing agricultural damage, as seen in countries like Thailand and India.  Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to resolve conflicts more consistently and effectively than humans since it is less susceptible to emotional.: 1 (0.7%)
  - In it's current state I would never trust AI over human interpretation. AI is just too new and humans have been doing this successfully far longer.: 1 (0.7%)
  - If AI is used ethically and properly such as described with elephants as a warning to both species that I would trust AI more because it would not harm the animal versus human will in order to save themselves.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Id trust it much less because we wouldn't know if its real interpretation or just generated response to fulfill the human its creator.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust humans with years of expertise and experience more. Humans are empathetic: 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust AI more than humans for animal communication in conflict resolution. AI offers faster, objective, data-driven interpretation of immediate behavior patterns, crucial for preventing human-wildlife clashes. It reduces human risk and provides scalable, consistent monitoring. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust AI less since there are no real consequences for failure and AI will routinely make stuff up and lie and there's no evolutionary pressure to not do that whereas humans must evolve to overcome that pressure.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I wouldn't fully trust ai as I'm sure the kinks are or have been completely worked out all the way yet: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust them more as they are more neutral.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust them both, I think we should do both : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust the AI more because they can resolve conflicts easily. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust more AI than humans, there might be people who put their own twisted benefits upfront and that’s something AI would least do: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust it more as it would provide a better way to end human-wildlife conflict which has been a major issue in many developed and developing countries: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more, as they possess the crucial empathy, contextual understanding, and ethical judgment that AI currently lacks for such delicate situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more than AI. The reason is that AI learns from given data, but humans have mastered and adapted to patterns more easily than AI, and it is by humans' insights that the capability of AI grows.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more because with humans I feel like they are less misconstrued compared to Ai. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more bases on their ability to have emotions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more and want AI to guide human. The reason is very simple. Human interpretation is way more accurate than Ai interpretation. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust both since they both have human input.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust animal experts more: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust a human more , but would like AI to double check the work and vise versa.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust Ai more because at least it will not hurt the animal and will warn people before disaster to at least they will not hurt the animal: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI to make an objective assessment since humans are interested party in the issue of human-wildlife conflict : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI to help humans regarding animal communication as it'll make the humans lives easier. We won't have to interact with animals physically, as the AI would be able to deter them away.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more, because it can process large amounts of data quickly and consistently without emotional bias. However, it still needs human oversight to ensure ethical use and to interpret context that AI might miss.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in conflicts, as it can process data objectively and detect subtle patterns. However, its effectiveness depends on ethical design and human oversight, so the best results come from humans and AI working together: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans in this case, because AI can process signals quickly and react faster to prevent harm. But I’d still worry about misinterpretation or over reliance. So I’d prefer AI to assist but not replace human judgment.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more. With sufficient data, AI can surpass human intuition, offering clearer insights into nonverbal, sensory-based communication systems.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more. AI is reliable and does not get exhausted hence it can be relied upon to prevent human-wildlife conflict around the clock unlike humans who operate in shifts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans. Humans solving human-wildlife conflict has not gone well in the past. We've driven animals to extinction, we use animals for our entertainment at their expense. AI could enable a warning system of sounds that express "STOP" or messages of guidance to lead the elephant towards more protected areas: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans in this scenario. AI, with its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, could potentially interpret animal communication more accurately and consistently than humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more since they can see more factors and data connections then i may know: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more if it has a good baseline, since it's more powerful than human interpretation. The AI just needs to have a good track record, otherwise I'd be more inclined to trust a human.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more for listening because it would be able to interpret complex sounds which human can not.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more compared to humans because AI can analyze large patterns of animal sounds to analyze when animals are stressed, hungry or defending territories. Humans can however project fears or assumptions onto animals leading to conflict escalation.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more cause it can seem a impartial than human and human motives. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more because it is smarter. AI knows everything because it is a robot, so if AI could have the ability to know if an animal is close then it could be better at interpreting animal communication.  : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more as they will be free of Bias: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more as I am sure that the AI would be tested many times before it was released for practical use. So I'm sure all of the "bugs" would have been fixed before the AI, was released for use in these situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less. I trust humans more because they are sentient and can decipher communication better: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans because you can never be too careful with AI. Humans at least can somewhat understand and help but AI is very unpredictable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less because it could be biased and misleading : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI as it has the ability to memorize information and has access to a wide range of information and sounds.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI a little to help solve human-animal conflicts because it can study patterns and suggest smart solutions. But people still need to decide with care and empathy, because AI might miss the deeper emotional or cultural parts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would suggest the use of both AI and Human resources to better communication: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would somewhat trust AI more than humans in this case, because AI can process large amounts of data quickly and recognize patterns that humans might miss. It can also operate without emotional bias. But I’d still be cautious, AI is only as good as the data and assumptions it’s built on, and misinterpretation could still lead to harm if not carefully monitored by experts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would say that with the advancement of AI technology there would be less room for error as opposed to with a human when trying to interpret animal communication and hopefully resolve any sort of conflict.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would say at this point I would trust AI more. When money is involved, most humans become compromised by greed and would use this technology somehow for their own benefit at the detriment of others be it humans or animals. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would probably trust AI more than humans in this context but with important caveats.
Humans often bring emotions, biases, or economic interests that can cloud judgment, especially in conflicts where livelihoods are at stake. AI, if designed well, could provide more objective, timely, and consistent warnings to both humans and animals, helping avoid dangerous encounters without escalating tensions.
That said, AI is only as good as its data and programming. It has to truly understand the animals: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would prefer human more because it is more accurate: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would not. I don't think AI think as emotionally as humans
: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would not trust ai i would like to keep the nature as is : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would moderately trust AI more than humans in this scenario because AI can process data impartially and operate 24/7 without fatigue, reducing missed warnings or biased judgments. For example, AI-enabled cameras can detect elephants’ movements objectively, while humans might overlook signs or react based on fear. However, I’d remain cautious—AI could misinterpret elephant vocalizations or fail in unexpected conditions (e.g., poor visibility). : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would likely trust humans more. We have experts in animal behavior and have been able to recognize patterns in behavior pretty well until now. AI would likely just misinterpret signals from whatever source they get their data from: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would AI slightly more because it can analyze patterns without bias, but it should work with human to ensure ethical and accurate interpretation.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more. It usually makes decision that are concrete and researched.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more to interpret animal communication.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more because it is less likely to be biased by any emotions and is more likely to be accurate : 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more because it is consistent and lack of emotional bias: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will likely trust AI more due to human selfishness: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will definitely trust humans more: 1 (0.7%)
  - I trust more on AI because it doesn't have any valid reason to hide the truth. It always give the better results based on algorithm: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think that if you could train AI to interpret animal communication to resolve wildlife human conflict it could take the emotional aspect away and could be a good thing.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think people are using AI for good things for now. But in the future, they will create a monster and it will start telling humans what to do.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think it is possible but the premise is that it does not affect animals. I think nature is already pretty good now and humans should not disturb other animals.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think a wild life specialist would have better insight than Ai, due to their hands on experience and their personal familiarity with the animal that they can show compassion and understanding for an animals reaction.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think I would trust humans since animal communications is far more complicated and needs good obervation for you to understand: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI offers early warnings and pattern recognition, but human empathy and judgment remain essential. According to me the strongest approach blends both.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI is relatively neutral - humans are more likely to be biased, and AI has a clear advantage when it comes to accessing large amounts of information: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI has the possibility to do it better than humans ever could. I'd rather the machine be there as a third party honestly. Animals would be mad at us. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I probably would trust it less than humans because there is no direct contact with these animals to form a proper resolve

: 1 (0.7%)
  - I only trust AI developers and institutions that work closely with animal experts/biologists, because only they are qualified and capable of creating qualified human-animal communication technology.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I may trust AI more because it has so much more computing power than one person's brain and can devote so much time to this task: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don’t really believe that AI can interpret the communication between animals, nor do I think it can resolve conflicts between humans and wild animals. This is because I don’t think AI can truly and completely interpret the communication between animals. I don’t think AI has enough data to do this, especially with wildlife. I’m also worried that AI will be abused, which will only cause greater harm to animals and a greater disruption to the balance of nature.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don’t quite believe it because artificial intelligence was invented by humans and is controlled by humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don't think AI can replace human interpretation. Too often, very subtle interactions between any animals are beyond the reach of AI.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I can't say I could trust the AI until I actually saw evidence that it works. For now, I'm inclined to believe in the traditional approach until I see a video of an AI speaking to an elephant and the elephant following commands : 1 (0.7%)
  - I can trust AI more because it is unbiased.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I believe that if AI can interpret it, then it can indeed solve some problems, just like the elephant example you gave.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I believe in humans more than artificial intelligence. I think humans have made considerable achievements in learning and exploring communication with animals. Artificial intelligence is ultimately a model based on existing human research data. If the natural environment changes, the habits of animals will also change, and they cannot be interpreted with a unified artificial intelligence algorithm.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I am not sure. However, I think if the AI can communicate accurately then I would trust it fully.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I am not sure If I would trust AI more probably less.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Human slave elephants to make money, yet they get angry when their crops been raided.  : 1 (0.7%)
  - Human and animal needs to respect and accept each others, if crops are eaten or destroyed, just get over it, even humans are getting hurt or killed, just have to learn how the natural world works. No one owns the land or lives in it.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Given that there is no actual case of either, there is no comparison of which is better. Humans have not proven to possess telepathy. And humans do have a habit to project human emotions and thoughts onto animals. In that sense, maybe AI could be more objective or "less biased," but Ai is trained by data fed to it by humans. : 1 (0.7%)
  - From a certain perspective, maybe I believe it, but this is more about the cooperative production between humans and animals. But if we look at animals as independent individuals, artificial intelligence may not be the best choice.: 1 (0.7%)
  - For this i would go with AI,i believe that AI are accurate than human: 1 (0.7%)
  - Depending on the situation, one could take more AI analytics, while others might just be common sense.: 1 (0.7%)
