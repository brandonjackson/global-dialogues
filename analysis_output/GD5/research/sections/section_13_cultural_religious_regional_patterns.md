**AI vs Human Trust in Wildlife Conflict Resolution by Country:**

India (n=183):
  - yes, because AI is not biased, its data driven , takes logical decision: 1 (0.5%)
  - yes I would trust AI to interpret animal communication more than humans because AI is capable of analyzing huge datasets and find patterns or sentiment analysis unlike humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - no, i would trust humans to interpret animal because of a reason of believe that there is an accountability and sort of trust that it is for betterment of human and wildlife conflicts. As human have many proactive groups to protect wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - less, becuase ai can't really feel anything, wheres human beings are complex creatures that have interacted with animals for a long time and understand emotions: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust more to ai rather going for humans 

: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust humans more than ai because ai lacks the nuance and heartfelt understanding that humans can provide: 1 (0.5%)
  - i would trust ai more because it interpret animal communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - i think ai and animals will not go as well as humans and animals cause of emotional capabilities: 1 (0.5%)
  - i don't fully trust on ai: 1 (0.5%)
  - because as a human we have to understand the feelings of animals as they cannot express themselves.: 1 (0.5%)
  - because AI is less prone to make mistake as humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - after reading above para maybe more , beacuse it is helpful

: 1 (0.5%)
  - You can trust that it will alert you: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes. Humans are rarely trustworthy.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, it will warn people in advance: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, humans should not destroy wildlife: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, because it saves both parties the animal kingdom & humans : 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, because ai could interpret better and would be able to resolve better: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I would somewhat trust AI to resolve a human wildlife conflict because this is something for which AI is one of the best solutions which minimizes the casualties caused due  to the same issue.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I trust ai to resolve communication between us: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, I think ai would interpret communicate to animals better than humans obv. It depends on the purpose of use.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes, AI enabled cameras are there definetely it will give some better inputs as compared to past. We can save ourselves as well as theirs. : 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes because over a period of time with proper advancements we can expect AI to be an intermediary between humans and animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Yes I would trust AI more than humans to interpret animals because I feel like humans might cheat more than AI when interpretation: 1 (0.5%)
  - Would trust ai here because it will be perfectly trained for the same: 1 (0.5%)
  - When it comes to deciphering animal communication in the context of resolving human-wildlife conflicts, I would have more trust in AI than I would humans. AI is capable of quickly analyzing large datasets, recognizing patterns in animal behavior, and offering early alerts with no emotional predisposition. AI can work with consistency and continuity that humans cannot and can lead to effective solutions to prevent conflict, thereby mitigating harm to both people and wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - We sould trust AI for complex work. If we train AI with better feeds or data then it'll do better work then any human.: 1 (0.5%)
  - We can make AI to behave in certain way also make AI to follow strict rules regarding safety and to mitigate risks. We can also easily monitor the behavior of AI. : 1 (0.5%)
  - Trust both equally as AI would give more precision data and human intelligence can make better decisions : 1 (0.5%)
  - To solve a himan wildlife conflict AI will be helpful as we will understand the situation and take actions accordingly : 1 (0.5%)
  - To save the crop from animals, AI can play an important role in saving crops as well as some danger may be avoided by use of AI technology in some danger because human can see animals in the camera and can understand the situation to save them from harmful animals ie lions,tigers etc.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Through careful planning, inclusive dialogue, and sustainable development practices, we can work  toward a future where infrastructure, agriculture, and mining projects contribute to, rather than detract from, the harmonious coexistence of people and wildlife: 1 (0.5%)
  - They interfere in with their life what they think about human I don't think these things are really matters.: 1 (0.5%)
  - The only problem is commercialization and loss of environmental habitats of animals. So human is responsible for this. It's better to work on this and return their home rather than making AI to work. AI is nowhere good. It's just like doing more bad. Why to resolve? Just return the homes of other species that's animals. Simple! : 1 (0.5%)
  - The given scenario was nice if it works. If AI could resolve the barrier/conflict it will be good for both humans and animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - The answer depends on the situation and place. If a mahout is there- he will communicate well to the elephant than AI, because he trained it, if you go for wildlife then it may be different scenario may AI perform well to communicate.: 1 (0.5%)
  - The Idea of resolving a wildlife conflict is great but do you really think the nature and the animals the way they are made and born they do have capacities to protect themselves and these artificial things which humans are doing in the name of development can interrupt their natural cycles and animals falls under for tests: 1 (0.5%)
  - The AI work properly, then I will definitely trust AI to resolve a human and wildlife communication. If the AI truly and accurately interpret the languages of animals. It will be good so that we can understand them better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Sometimes animal behavior is very different from other human beings : 1 (0.5%)
  - Not at all. Even today, when I used AI for, 3rd time only it gave a correct answer. Shamelessly, it gave the first wrong answer the first 2 times and continued with sorry for clarification, waiting, giving another chance etc. So, is there any difference when it comes to Animals? It's gonna be worse.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Nope it might result in more loss of lives on both ends: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I would want both AI and humans because both need at sometimes AI wont be getting the nature feels which human can help in and the AI can help them in making things easier for the humans to understand and make progress.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I would not trust. You see, first humans take away elephant corridors to build homes, and then complain about man-animal conflicts. The AI will be trained by humans only and I expect, humans to aid human's concerns, not the animals'; so a wrong interpretation, or a purposefully wrong interpretation could lead to havoc.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I don't trust AI to interpret animal communications to resolve a human wildlife conflict because of the reliability or accuracy of the interpretation done by AI. Wrong or misleading interpretation may lead to major consequences, making matters from bad to worse.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No, I don't think so we can fully rely on AI technology for interspecies communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - No comment as i don't trust them doing justice less or more: 1 (0.5%)
  - No because like I mentioned before AI can be inaccurate and misinterpret language and it may cause more confusions: 1 (0.5%)
  - No I wouldn't. Ai should only be used as assistant to humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - No I can't trust it completely because there may be cases were the AI may misinterpret: 1 (0.5%)
  - More, as less ulterior motive and superior knowledge : 1 (0.5%)
  - More because it has a logical approach and no emotions.: 1 (0.5%)
  - More because AI can interpret without personal prejudice: 1 (0.5%)
  - Maybe I would still trust a scientist researching in the field more. AI is only a tool we turn to for help. I don't think there will be a day when I trust it a cent percent: 1 (0.5%)
  - Machines cannot be trusted for 100% translation and it doesn't sound like a good idea : 1 (0.5%)
  - Lyes i would. Because it will be efficient: 1 (0.5%)
  - Less. Or may be even equal to humans. Even if it interprets, resolution requires human involvement : 1 (0.5%)
  - Less actually. If they are tame animals like elephants, humans must know how to behave with them to calm them down: 1 (0.5%)
  - It's really change overall situation if ai alert before so animals and crops and human all are safe and we can protect them: 1 (0.5%)
  - It would be obvious that AI can communicate and interpret between human and wildlife because a i itself is trained by professional humans in their subject matter and I think it would not only resolve human wildlife conflict but will also bring a concern regarding humans who can misuse this: 1 (0.5%)
  - It will surely resolve human wildlife conflict because if we better understand animals better will be dealing with animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It varies, depending on the type of application for which i use AI, the trust also varies.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It is not about AI but who is using and who is controlling. If there are enough rules by government. How to use AI and with good regulations AI is helpful but who will check the rule and law. : 1 (0.5%)
  - It is a better option and trusted one because it saves life and avoids many bad situation among them: 1 (0.5%)
  - It is a 50-50 for me. For the collection and analysis of data, using AI can be helpful, but relying entirely on an AI system can be harmful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It help human and animals also its best and i trust the process: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends. AI can work in a great manner when it comes to tracking only a certain radius and warning humans about incoming troops of animals. However, if we're dependent solely on AI, I think AI will somewhat be biased to help humans more and neglect animals to an extent. Humans have trained the models, not animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends upon the condition and I think somewhere ,somewhat AI can resolve the conflict issue,as it is in some cases more accurate and can be useful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends on who the human invigilator is. If the person belongs to animal right organizations, i would trust the human more than AI, otherwise not.: 1 (0.5%)
  - It depends on how well it is developed as there are two sided coins here both elephants and humans, and if the ai isn't properly developed it can lead to a disaster between them so if the ai is tested well it can be trusted or else nope.: 1 (0.5%)
  - In this scenario, it will be helpful for both farmers and animals. there will be lesser conflicts, so harm to both will be very less.: 1 (0.5%)
  - In case of understanding emotions, i prefer Humans are better than AIm: 1 (0.5%)
  - If the AI systems can interpret the messages well, then I would trust them. : 1 (0.5%)
  - If that happens it is good for every human and animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - If programmed correctly or ethically than AI can be proven better than humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - If it means avoiding conflict and it is just a warning system, it would help protect animals: 1 (0.5%)
  - If a person is trained to understand animals, I would 100% choose him/her. But if there is no trained person, then I can trust AI so that no harm is occurred.: 1 (0.5%)
  - IF AI CAN COMPLETELY INTERPRET ANIMAL COMMUNICATION THEN WE CAN TRUST AI. THE AI  MAY NOT INTERPRET COMPLETELY ,WHICH MAY CAUSE MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN ANIMALS AND HUMANS.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I'm not sure which is more effective.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust the ai as it relies on research and understanding: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust more about AI technology as it is reliable and communication made with animals will surely help community. There will not be personal conflicts and resolution will be in favour of both animals and humans : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust it less. AI just simply can't be trusted. It's literally just an amalgamation of a lot of numbers and facts. It cannot act in my best interest because it can never fully encapsulate the complexity of being human and decision making.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust it if I knew the model had been trained enough and how it's working. We can't trust AI at the initial stages to just go out there and resolve a major conflict.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans to interpret : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more to interpret animal communication as humans are able to instill a sense of love and kindness behind their actions, which might not be possible when an AI would be used.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more than AI to understand animals. Human have lived with animals from eons and understand them much better than a soulless entity getting it's information from data storages. Humans can see and feel what an animal is going through and what they trying to communicate based on our past experiences. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust humans more as they have a stronger grasp on emotions while AI is a machine.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust ai more in interpret animal comunication because humans can't communicate with animals without help of ai: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust a human more since humans and elephants have had a good standing relationship for a long time : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust a AI same as a human: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI to interpret a possible human-animal conflict, only if it produces unbiased and effective results.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI to do better to interpret animal communication so that we could help Animals in need: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in resolving human-wildlife conflicts, mainly because AI can process vast amounts of data quickly and detect patterns humans might miss. Unlike humans, AI can remain objective and consistent, which is important in sensitive situations. However, I’d still want human oversight to ensure cultural and ecological factors are considered.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI since AI can have millions of historical data / behavioural data to understand animals better. Moreover, all these years where humans have been understanding the animals, their life haven't changed for any better. So, this time for AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI over humans to interpret animal communication to resolve a human-wildlife conflict because AI would be able to decode signals that humans cannot.  There would be no bias from AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans since AI is not emotional like humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans in this specific scenario, but with safeguards. AI can process patterns impartially (e.g., elephant movement data) without emotional bias, and systems like camera alerts already reduce conflicts. However, human oversight is still needed to ensure AI doesn’t ignore contextual nuances or unintended consequences—like disrupting elephant migration routes. The ideal approach would combine AI’s efficiency with ethologists’ expertise.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more in this case. Humans can talk like humans. But AI can mimic animals' voices, making it far more realistic.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more if it is developed by a reputed company known for high standards: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more because it is unbiased unlike humans.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more because it can quickly interpret data. I don't think humans understamd animals that much or might be impatient with it and worry about their own selfish motives. It is better to have AI as a neutral and unbiased interpreter of the sounds and behavior of animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as long as it is programmed ethically and is not harmful to animals.  : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as it is more efficient since it doesn't require rest as human does, but we should make sure that no 3rd party have access to the system or else it can be manipulated.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI more as it does not have emotions or any intents of personal gains: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans are AI is programmed by human only. So AI will only shows those results which are already programmed in it

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI less as mostly AI uses a set of data to learn things which is mostly provided by humans: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in this regard as human do not know how to interpret the elephant language: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in terms of help in communicating with the animals and we can know how they feel when they are hurt.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI in such cases as it may benefit humans and doesn't cause direct harm to animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would trust AI a little more in such cases, especially when it comes to early detection and accurate warning. AI can quickly gather data from cameras and sensors to determine if elephants are approaching farms, and take immediate action, which humans may not be able to do with such rapid and constant monitoring. Also, AI can understand elephant movements and behavior better by recognizing repeated patterns.

However, I would be a little cautious when it comes to communicating directly with elephants.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would support AI more in such a scenario, as long as it only relays information to the humans, but does not step in as a mediator 

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would somewhat trust AI more than humans to interpret animal communication in conflict situations because it can process large amounts of data quickly, detect subtle patterns, and respond consistently without emotional bias or fear. However, I’d still be cautious that AI is built by humans, and its priorities might reflect human-centered goals rather than what's best for animals. There’s a risk it could be used to control or manipulate rather than truly understand and coexist.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would not trust ai more than the humans to interpret animal communications. Ai feeds on the data provided where as we as humans can feel the emotions of the animals : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would not trust AI more than humans to interpret animal. I would use AI during absence of skilled human communicator: 1 (0.5%)
  - I would never trust ai in this.  Because, people need to know ai does not have empathy, it's a great deal riskier to trust people as it is, so it's better to resolve any conflicts by considering the wellfare of both animals and humans. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I would definitely trust AI in some situations but if its a human who has widely studied the animal's behaviour he would be able to take a better approach in resolving conflicts. Compared to the average human, AI would be better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I won’t fully trust an ai unless there’s also a person working with ai.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I wont trust AI completely or more. An AI's program can be changed or easily manipulated. If there is a company or group of individuals who can benefit from these human-wildlife conflict and if they can use this AI to make things worse, it would be bad idea.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I won't trust anyone unless I get better knowledge : 1 (0.5%)
  - I will trust it more because AI can understand the needs of wild animals, what are their needs, what are the problems of their families, AI will be useful for understanding all this.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I will trust AI more as humans can often change their mind to fulfill their narrow self interest but an AI won't do that.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I will never trust AI because its usage in any way could be dangerous for human and for animal as well .: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust more on AI than human because human are more cruel now a days.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust in AI, because some humans can understand or interpret the animals' language and their routine. I think it will help to make AI better.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust humans more as they have good communication developed as a part of nature, and the solutions that are developed are from the ability of mankind and nature.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust human more as ai could make mistskes: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust ai more to interpret animal communication: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI, but humans still cannot communicate with animals effectively: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more. In India there is many cases of human wildlife conflict. AI will help creating warning systems, maybe not communictaing system but some devices we can use for diverting animals from farms. And lead them further in forset or in their habitat: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more, as humans can be aggressive while AI can act in controlled manner: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more to interpret animal communication because it won't be biased and it is more intelligent to interpret.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more than humans in terms of interpretation, because AI is more advanced than humans and, unlike humans, can analyze millions of possibilities simultaneously.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more because it helps humans and they can already know what kind of activities they are doing: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI more as it has lesser bias: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI if its truly gives the positive results.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI if it warn people about elephant roaming near crops. It will help to reduce the damange.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI don't have any bias like human beings and trust the AI : 1 (0.5%)
  - I trust AI a bit more as it can process many sounds and patterns quickly, but it still needs human help to understand feelings and nature better. So, both should work together.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think, in this case, an AI system would be very helpful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think they are the same. AI exists from human input. I'd rather trust someone who can speak from instinct and presence than pre-programmed responses. That is, a human would be a better bet. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I think it should be a mix of human and AI interpretation. AI may play a vital role in evolving human interpretation of animals.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think it depends on how to communication is done, is it only verbal or physical as well. I think verbal communication if done using AI in non harmful way can be trusted but needs to be see n how it will be done, how will the training process be will it follows nature's rules?: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think I would trust AI to some extent to resolve a human-wildlife conflict because it would save many lives of animals as well as humans. It would let the animals live a peaceful life.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think I can trust AI more than Humans but not like that as it can harm animals badly in many ways.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think Ai would be a good option: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think AI can't understand feelings: 1 (0.5%)
  - I think AI can better interpret animals because although human has made AI but AI is far better than human thinking.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I somewhat trust AI more than humans. Because humans can interpret communication for their own benefit while AI can't : 1 (0.5%)
  - I preferably not fully trust the AI because animal commnication should be different because of their culture.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I guess somehow I trust human more but this technology is good for future : 1 (0.5%)
  - I feel AI can interpret the animals well than humans. It would be safe to use AI to understand animals without taking risk of attack from animals to understand them. AI help us to protect our surrounding by understanding the animals preferences. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I dont think the use of AI in this situation is necessary as it may be emotional situation and it should be resolved by human for the given conflict as AI can’t interpret accurately during a communication and it may lead to a more danger situation : 1 (0.5%)
  - I don't trust AI so much because use of AI is less means no problem : 1 (0.5%)
  - I dmt think its a good idea to open the doors that nature has locked for us for so many reasons. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I cant say in which way AI could be used because there can be extreme worst and extreme good as well.: 1 (0.5%)
  - I can trust AI more because when someone can communicate with animals, why are they doing so with others? They can communicate with the same intensity to others so this can end the conflict between the humans and animals.

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I can not fully agree towards the fact  That Ai can be used for good purpose only. I think human intervention is must in case of these sensitive topics: 1 (0.5%)
  - I am not sure. With the humans mind when the helpful thing can turn into horror for someone

: 1 (0.5%)
  - I am not sure because countries with deeply advanced forensic aerial surveillance have been 'attacked' and their border barbed wire fences stormed by adversarial groups. So I am not sure if this would help wild animals and locals. : 1 (0.5%)
  - I agree to a limited scope that AI has a good shot in future to interpret the communication and help in some ways: 1 (0.5%)
  - Humans have sixth sense and animals dont, So I would trust AI to warn us about the animals near farms which would prevent crop loss or any accidents caused by the animals. So I would trust the AI in this way.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Honestly speaking, I personally am not quite in the favour of interpreting animal conversation by AI. Animals dont attack by themselves, they do so in order to protect themselves or their family. So no point of Human Wildlife Conflict.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Equally trust humans and AI as both have different strength and weakness: 1 (0.5%)
  - Depends on the AI's prior results, if it has a good track record then why not. If not then humans with experience is a better choice.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Because in the end they are just machines that can be manipulated by human beings and I don't trust human beings with lot of power : 1 (0.5%)
  - Bcz AI can process vast amounts of data like sounds, movements, and patterns consistently and without bias. It can detect subtle signals or trends that humans might miss due to limited attention or emotional involvement.: 1 (0.5%)
  - Automation is definitely needed where we need to reduce human animal conflicts especially in case of big therms like elephants. Why automation? because automation regular monitoring and at time reminders/alarms/triggers about animal activity and doing all that without human help could be really useful. And I think AI could bring that automation we need: 1 (0.5%)
  - Anyone’s judgement can be faulty there’s no right answer to it: 1 (0.5%)
  - Ai because its beyond human mind

: 1 (0.5%)
  - About the same. Trained professionals whether AI or human do have experience in dealing with these issues.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI's ability to process vast amounts of complex data without emotional biases, identify subtle patterns, and potentially learn the nuances of animal communication more objectively than humans could lead to more effective and less disruptive solutions, prioritizing the well-being of both humans and wildlife.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI will help both human beings and animals live in harmony without conflicts. I trust AI.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI may provide wrong answers : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI may be able to detect animal attack in advance. In that case a human and Anamal conflict can be avoided.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is technology and will have flaws and the experiment to learn animal language is absurd.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is suitable for human purposes and for animals they doesn't give consent about interpretation . : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is human operated any human with malicious intent can manipulate or mislead animal communication. So I don't want to trust neither human nor AI: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is human effort.I believe AI have advantages and disadvantages.If AI can work accurate that would be appropriatable.But some point if AI can't understand completely animals behaviour that would be wrong direction to make: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI is a virtual thing and humans are real. I definitely trust humans more than AI because AI only acts on the prefed or inbuilt data that was recorded and integrated by humans only. So AI is dependent whereas humans not. Animals are not conflicting with humans, its human which is interfering in animal territories. If they stop doing so there will be no conflict at all which needs and AI solutions. : 1 (0.5%)
  - AI could be trusted more here because if AI system is trained properly with a large dataset of different animal signals and sounds which are interpreted correctly then it could be useful.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI can have a large data set to make a better informed decision which only a few human may possess when communicating with an animal.: 1 (0.5%)
  - AI can be a useful tool, but without human sensitivity and ethical judgements, it cannot provide sustainable solutions to wildlife conflicts. The trust must be on an AI + human partnership.: 1 (0.5%)
  - A little more because the technology could enable earning : 1 (0.5%)
  - 
In technical reliability, many may lean toward AI; in ethical, emotional, and interpretive trust, many still prefer experienced humans. The ideal future may involve collaboration AI tools supporting human insight rather than replacing it combining the speed and scale of machines with the wisdom and empathy of human understanding.: 1 (0.5%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 1.1%**

United States (n=151):
  - yes, because i feel they'll interpret it more better: 1 (0.7%)
  - yes sure because it might mostly get and interpret most animal sounds.: 1 (0.7%)
  - less so.. because AI is a tool that humans use but one that is more removed from humans than say their hands or voice. so there is less control. : 1 (0.7%)
  - id trust AI to communicate with animals over humans: 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust it less, because i'm not sure if it is able to correctly interpret the animals' intentions, while humans might have more experience with those. : 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust humans more because we can receive context clues to make more of an informed decision of the animals body language in addition to the communication we are trying to decode. : 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust AI more than humna because humans can be funny: 1 (0.7%)
  - i would trust AI it will take good data: 1 (0.7%)
  - i will trust Ai more because it will be sincere and not biases: 1 (0.7%)
  - i will trust AI in interpreting animal communication to resolve human wildlife conflict because AI strength

AI can analyze data without emotional bias,potentially leading to more accurate interpretation

AI can process large account of data from varous sources

AI can apply consistent rules and frame works to interpret animal communication,reducing variability in interpretation: 1 (0.7%)
  - i believe Ai cant be bias except with human manipulations of codes and an AI system would mostly give accurate result except in cases there mistakes in codes : 1 (0.7%)
  - humans are much more sophisticated brain wise therefore for the human wildlife conflict a human angle will be much more appreciated : 1 (0.7%)
  - ai because i feel it would be less biased compared to humans: 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes, this is why, speed and consistency as AI can analyze and respond to animal communication in real time and consistently something humans might struggle with especially in dynamic and rapidly changing situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes, I would trust AI more than humans : 1 (0.7%)
  - Yes I suppose that would be a good use to it as it involves human intervention.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Why disturb the lives of wild animals? Wouldn’t it be better to give them some living space?: 1 (0.7%)
  - Why I’d Trust AI More Than Humans and But Human Judgment Is Still Necessary Because: 1 (0.7%)
  - What I can say is, I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in these situations but only if it's developed carefully and ethically.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Using AI to avoid harm between animals and humans will definitely be positive for both species. : 1 (0.7%)
  - The application of AI in solving human-wildlife conflicts would make me slightly more confident than humans, as it does not have the emotional bias to the vast amount of data and can notice the pattern that humans probably would not. Nonetheless, it must be under the management of a human being so as to make ethical and contextually adequate decisions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Probably ai to communicate with animals because you simply can communicate with animals.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Probably AI, they are more advanced and trained : 1 (0.7%)
  - Overall, I trust expert human more than AI more than average human in any area, including animal communication. I believe that AI can achieve a reasonable level of accuracy in human-wildlife conflict given enough data to dig out patterns.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Obviously I would trust AI more, since the track record of human communication with animals is abysmal (98% of the world isn't vegan, etc.).: 1 (0.7%)
  - None, both AI and humans are connected.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No. Communication is complex, and subtle nuances may not be detected by AI. Human experts on certain animal species, who can correctly recognize warning signs or hostility from animals, would be more reliable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No, humans has natural gift on how to communicate with other species : 1 (0.7%)
  - No the reason behind that is because the one programming the AI has no interaction with the animals compared to the human interpreter.: 1 (0.7%)
  - No i would trust Humans more to interprete animal language: 1 (0.7%)
  - Neutral. I can't tell who to trust more: 1 (0.7%)
  - Neither. I don't really trust either: 1 (0.7%)
  - More than humans because AI wouldn't have emotions effecting it's decisions: 1 (0.7%)
  - Maybe, if AI can talk to animals correctly, it could guide them to avoid conflict.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Maybe less because it is untested and unfamiliar.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Less than humans because AI lacks the complexity of thoughts: 1 (0.7%)
  - Less than human... An ai can never have human empathy or human senses which animals pick up on: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI slightly more than humans in resolving conflicts, but only when paired with ethical oversight and human insight. Combining both would lead to the most respectful and effective solutions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more to give fast, unbiased warnings, but humans still need to understand and respect animals deeply to truly solve the problem. 

: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more than humans—if rigorously validated—because it can analyze vast, subtle patterns in elephant calls objectively and at scale, warning farmers and even signaling elephants without human bias or delay. However, I’d insist on transparent methods and oversight to ensure its “translations” truly reflect elephant intentions rather than our assumptions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more than humans for interpreting and managing human-wildlife conflict communication, because AI can process vast amounts of data quickly, detect subtle patterns, and provide consistent, real-time warnings without human biases or fatigue. Humans might misinterpret signals or react emotionally, especially in stressful conflict situations, whereas AI systems can remain objective.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more because it can react faster and more could help prevent conflict before it happens: 1 (0.7%)
  - I’d trust AI more because it can notice tiny details that people might miss. AI doesn’t get tired or make guesses based on feelings. But I’d still want a person to check its work, just in case. Together, AI and humans could make better choices for both people and animals. That way, we use technology and kindness to keep everyone safe.: 1 (0.7%)
  - It depends on the human. AI is a trained model that can be predictable, while humans are variable and unpredictable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - In the example given, in Thailand, India and Tanzania, it never occurred to me that this would be a use for AI. This is a really interesting idea, and I think if humans are in charge of the research and projects, AI would definitely be a valued asset. I don't think AI should be used without human input, in this type of situation. : 1 (0.7%)
  - In order to decipher animal communication and settle disputes between people and nature, I would put more faith in AI than in humans.  AI can give objective data through technology like webcams to alert people and allow direct communication with elephants, reducing agricultural damage, as seen in countries like Thailand and India.  Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to resolve conflicts more consistently and effectively than humans since it is less susceptible to emotional.: 1 (0.7%)
  - In it's current state I would never trust AI over human interpretation. AI is just too new and humans have been doing this successfully far longer.: 1 (0.7%)
  - If AI is used ethically and properly such as described with elephants as a warning to both species that I would trust AI more because it would not harm the animal versus human will in order to save themselves.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Id trust it much less because we wouldn't know if its real interpretation or just generated response to fulfill the human its creator.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust humans with years of expertise and experience more. Humans are empathetic: 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust AI more than humans for animal communication in conflict resolution. AI offers faster, objective, data-driven interpretation of immediate behavior patterns, crucial for preventing human-wildlife clashes. It reduces human risk and provides scalable, consistent monitoring. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I'd trust AI less since there are no real consequences for failure and AI will routinely make stuff up and lie and there's no evolutionary pressure to not do that whereas humans must evolve to overcome that pressure.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I wouldn't fully trust ai as I'm sure the kinks are or have been completely worked out all the way yet: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust them more as they are more neutral.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust them both, I think we should do both : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust the AI more because they can resolve conflicts easily. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust more AI than humans, there might be people who put their own twisted benefits upfront and that’s something AI would least do: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust it more as it would provide a better way to end human-wildlife conflict which has been a major issue in many developed and developing countries: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more, as they possess the crucial empathy, contextual understanding, and ethical judgment that AI currently lacks for such delicate situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more than AI. The reason is that AI learns from given data, but humans have mastered and adapted to patterns more easily than AI, and it is by humans' insights that the capability of AI grows.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more because with humans I feel like they are less misconstrued compared to Ai. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more bases on their ability to have emotions.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust humans more and want AI to guide human. The reason is very simple. Human interpretation is way more accurate than Ai interpretation. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust both since they both have human input.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust animal experts more: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust a human more , but would like AI to double check the work and vise versa.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust Ai more because at least it will not hurt the animal and will warn people before disaster to at least they will not hurt the animal: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI to make an objective assessment since humans are interested party in the issue of human-wildlife conflict : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI to help humans regarding animal communication as it'll make the humans lives easier. We won't have to interact with animals physically, as the AI would be able to deter them away.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more, because it can process large amounts of data quickly and consistently without emotional bias. However, it still needs human oversight to ensure ethical use and to interpret context that AI might miss.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in conflicts, as it can process data objectively and detect subtle patterns. However, its effectiveness depends on ethical design and human oversight, so the best results come from humans and AI working together: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans in this case, because AI can process signals quickly and react faster to prevent harm. But I’d still worry about misinterpretation or over reliance. So I’d prefer AI to assist but not replace human judgment.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more. With sufficient data, AI can surpass human intuition, offering clearer insights into nonverbal, sensory-based communication systems.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more. AI is reliable and does not get exhausted hence it can be relied upon to prevent human-wildlife conflict around the clock unlike humans who operate in shifts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans. Humans solving human-wildlife conflict has not gone well in the past. We've driven animals to extinction, we use animals for our entertainment at their expense. AI could enable a warning system of sounds that express "STOP" or messages of guidance to lead the elephant towards more protected areas: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans in this scenario. AI, with its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns, could potentially interpret animal communication more accurately and consistently than humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more since they can see more factors and data connections then i may know: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more if it has a good baseline, since it's more powerful than human interpretation. The AI just needs to have a good track record, otherwise I'd be more inclined to trust a human.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more for listening because it would be able to interpret complex sounds which human can not.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more compared to humans because AI can analyze large patterns of animal sounds to analyze when animals are stressed, hungry or defending territories. Humans can however project fears or assumptions onto animals leading to conflict escalation.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more cause it can seem a impartial than human and human motives. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more because it is smarter. AI knows everything because it is a robot, so if AI could have the ability to know if an animal is close then it could be better at interpreting animal communication.  : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more as they will be free of Bias: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI more as I am sure that the AI would be tested many times before it was released for practical use. So I'm sure all of the "bugs" would have been fixed before the AI, was released for use in these situations.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less. I trust humans more because they are sentient and can decipher communication better: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans because you can never be too careful with AI. Humans at least can somewhat understand and help but AI is very unpredictable.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI less because it could be biased and misleading : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI as it has the ability to memorize information and has access to a wide range of information and sounds.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would trust AI a little to help solve human-animal conflicts because it can study patterns and suggest smart solutions. But people still need to decide with care and empathy, because AI might miss the deeper emotional or cultural parts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would suggest the use of both AI and Human resources to better communication: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would somewhat trust AI more than humans in this case, because AI can process large amounts of data quickly and recognize patterns that humans might miss. It can also operate without emotional bias. But I’d still be cautious, AI is only as good as the data and assumptions it’s built on, and misinterpretation could still lead to harm if not carefully monitored by experts.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would say that with the advancement of AI technology there would be less room for error as opposed to with a human when trying to interpret animal communication and hopefully resolve any sort of conflict.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would say at this point I would trust AI more. When money is involved, most humans become compromised by greed and would use this technology somehow for their own benefit at the detriment of others be it humans or animals. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would probably trust AI more than humans in this context but with important caveats.
Humans often bring emotions, biases, or economic interests that can cloud judgment, especially in conflicts where livelihoods are at stake. AI, if designed well, could provide more objective, timely, and consistent warnings to both humans and animals, helping avoid dangerous encounters without escalating tensions.
That said, AI is only as good as its data and programming. It has to truly understand the animals: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would prefer human more because it is more accurate: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would not. I don't think AI think as emotionally as humans
: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would not trust ai i would like to keep the nature as is : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would moderately trust AI more than humans in this scenario because AI can process data impartially and operate 24/7 without fatigue, reducing missed warnings or biased judgments. For example, AI-enabled cameras can detect elephants’ movements objectively, while humans might overlook signs or react based on fear. However, I’d remain cautious—AI could misinterpret elephant vocalizations or fail in unexpected conditions (e.g., poor visibility). : 1 (0.7%)
  - I would likely trust humans more. We have experts in animal behavior and have been able to recognize patterns in behavior pretty well until now. AI would likely just misinterpret signals from whatever source they get their data from: 1 (0.7%)
  - I would AI slightly more because it can analyze patterns without bias, but it should work with human to ensure ethical and accurate interpretation.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more. It usually makes decision that are concrete and researched.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more to interpret animal communication.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more because it is less likely to be biased by any emotions and is more likely to be accurate : 1 (0.7%)
  - I will trust AI more because it is consistent and lack of emotional bias: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will likely trust AI more due to human selfishness: 1 (0.7%)
  - I will definitely trust humans more: 1 (0.7%)
  - I trust more on AI because it doesn't have any valid reason to hide the truth. It always give the better results based on algorithm: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think that if you could train AI to interpret animal communication to resolve wildlife human conflict it could take the emotional aspect away and could be a good thing.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think people are using AI for good things for now. But in the future, they will create a monster and it will start telling humans what to do.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think it is possible but the premise is that it does not affect animals. I think nature is already pretty good now and humans should not disturb other animals.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think a wild life specialist would have better insight than Ai, due to their hands on experience and their personal familiarity with the animal that they can show compassion and understanding for an animals reaction.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think I would trust humans since animal communications is far more complicated and needs good obervation for you to understand: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI offers early warnings and pattern recognition, but human empathy and judgment remain essential. According to me the strongest approach blends both.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI is relatively neutral - humans are more likely to be biased, and AI has a clear advantage when it comes to accessing large amounts of information: 1 (0.7%)
  - I think AI has the possibility to do it better than humans ever could. I'd rather the machine be there as a third party honestly. Animals would be mad at us. : 1 (0.7%)
  - I probably would trust it less than humans because there is no direct contact with these animals to form a proper resolve

: 1 (0.7%)
  - I only trust AI developers and institutions that work closely with animal experts/biologists, because only they are qualified and capable of creating qualified human-animal communication technology.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I may trust AI more because it has so much more computing power than one person's brain and can devote so much time to this task: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don’t really believe that AI can interpret the communication between animals, nor do I think it can resolve conflicts between humans and wild animals. This is because I don’t think AI can truly and completely interpret the communication between animals. I don’t think AI has enough data to do this, especially with wildlife. I’m also worried that AI will be abused, which will only cause greater harm to animals and a greater disruption to the balance of nature.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don’t quite believe it because artificial intelligence was invented by humans and is controlled by humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I don't think AI can replace human interpretation. Too often, very subtle interactions between any animals are beyond the reach of AI.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I can't say I could trust the AI until I actually saw evidence that it works. For now, I'm inclined to believe in the traditional approach until I see a video of an AI speaking to an elephant and the elephant following commands : 1 (0.7%)
  - I can trust AI more because it is unbiased.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I believe that if AI can interpret it, then it can indeed solve some problems, just like the elephant example you gave.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I believe in humans more than artificial intelligence. I think humans have made considerable achievements in learning and exploring communication with animals. Artificial intelligence is ultimately a model based on existing human research data. If the natural environment changes, the habits of animals will also change, and they cannot be interpreted with a unified artificial intelligence algorithm.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I am not sure. However, I think if the AI can communicate accurately then I would trust it fully.: 1 (0.7%)
  - I am not sure If I would trust AI more probably less.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Human slave elephants to make money, yet they get angry when their crops been raided.  : 1 (0.7%)
  - Human and animal needs to respect and accept each others, if crops are eaten or destroyed, just get over it, even humans are getting hurt or killed, just have to learn how the natural world works. No one owns the land or lives in it.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Given that there is no actual case of either, there is no comparison of which is better. Humans have not proven to possess telepathy. And humans do have a habit to project human emotions and thoughts onto animals. In that sense, maybe AI could be more objective or "less biased," but Ai is trained by data fed to it by humans. : 1 (0.7%)
  - From a certain perspective, maybe I believe it, but this is more about the cooperative production between humans and animals. But if we look at animals as independent individuals, artificial intelligence may not be the best choice.: 1 (0.7%)
  - For this i would go with AI,i believe that AI are accurate than human: 1 (0.7%)
  - Depending on the situation, one could take more AI analytics, while others might just be common sense.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Compared to humans, AI is more efficient in processing large amounts of data and identifying animal behavior patterns, which helps to quickly and accurately predict and respond to potential conflicts. But I don’t completely trust AI because it lacks a comprehensive understanding of ecology and animal emotions, and still requires human ethical judgment and supervision.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Because they are one with each other : 1 (0.7%)
  - Because humans and wild animals will have direct conflicts of interest, it is difficult to truly solve the problem: 1 (0.7%)
  - Because AI could possibly learn how the animals communicate and be able to communicate better with them than humans. Also I would think just sounds from AI would be a lot less intimidating to animals than having a physical person there that theyre afraid of.: 1 (0.7%)
  - Ai, it is less likely to make mistakes, unlike humans: 1 (0.7%)
  - Again, AI could only exists by human programming and only be utilized through human interpretation. I don't see how it would be any better than humans in the first place.: 1 (0.7%)
  - About the sme. This is because AI data is usually given by humans, so I would remain neutral as AI would only answer me based on responses used to train it by humans.: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI would be more trusting because of its ability to not be persuaded by different views or interests. : 1 (0.7%)
  - AI would be more trusted with a slight influence on experts because it would be quick and constant only in case of ethical control, before it can cause some kind of damage or be misinterpreted.: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI offers objective, data-driven analysis of vast animal communication patterns, avoiding human biases. Its consistency, speed, and potential for learning are crucial for real-time conflict prevention, surpassing individual human capacity.

: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI more it is gonna be so much smarter eventually: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI may misinterpret animals feeling and end up giving wrong information.: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI may have better insight into what animals think and feel but it would still be reliant on the research conducted and provided by humans. : 1 (0.7%)
  - AI may be able to signal elephants to avoid crops, but that does nothiong to solve the problem of humans encroaching more and more on the wild places that elephants and so many other species need for their survival. Elephants eat crops because we've destroyed their natural food sources. i don't see AI's interpreting their communications as as a solution for that.: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI is more trustworthy than humans because if it is created without bad ethics, it is always going to be more accurate than any human. Especially once AI gets to the level where it learns by itself.: 1 (0.7%)
  - AI could be helpful, surely, with the advances in AI, they will be able to communicate very effectively, and would inspire trust over humans who cannot communicate with animals.: 1 (0.7%)
  - A I would likely to interpret what was actually sick: 1 (0.7%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 1.3%**

China (n=61):
  - people will chase their own benefits: 1 (1.6%)
  - i trust AI more than humans. because humans are more selfish and biased and self-centered: 1 (1.6%)
  - hard to say, if it's a human expert I guess I trust the human more: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes. Rather than comparing with humans, I think AI is actually helping humans communicate with animals. If this technology can mature, humans will have more considerations when planning nature reserves or building human gathering areas and animal habitats.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes. Artificial intelligence is best able to quickly and unbiasedly collect large amounts of data, quickly analyze it, find patterns, and thus come up with reasonable solutions.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes, mainly because of whether there is a conflict of interest. If not, I will trust it more.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes, if the technology matures to a certain level, AI can more accurately identify the various complex sounds of animals in nature. As you mentioned earlier, AI can issue early warnings when wild animals approach farms, effectively avoiding conflicts between humans and wild animals.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes, because artificial intelligence has no interests of its own, it can resolve conflicts between humans and animals in a relatively neutral manner.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes, because artificial intelligence can develop rapidly. It may not work at first, but it will always improve in the future.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Yes, because AI has no emotions or preferences and is more likely to remain neutral than humans.: 1 (1.6%)
  - That's not the case. I think humans will always take precedence over AI in cultural exchange. AI is just a tool.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Not really. Essentially, conflicts over crop damage stem more from economic issues than a lack of communication.: 1 (1.6%)
  - No. Not until we can ensure the performance level of AI is on par with that of humans.: 1 (1.6%)
  - No. In the above example, it only proves that artificial intelligence can identify potential threats posed by wild animals, but it does not mean that artificial intelligence can replace humans in communicating with wild animals.: 1 (1.6%)
  - No, AI has no emotions, physical or behavioral movements.: 1 (1.6%)
  - More, I think AI should be helpful because animals can then understand humans' concerns and can avoid damaging human properties, leading to fewer human-animal conflicts: 1 (1.6%)
  - Less because Im not sure if the technology is mature enougg: 1 (1.6%)
  - I’m not completely convinced that AI may help humans communicate with wild animals by helping to identify animal calls of different frequencies and combinations, but I think that as humans have encroached on many wildlife habitats, a large part of the conflict cannot be resolved simply through AI interpretation, but requires action by humans themselves.: 1 (1.6%)
  - It's difficult because animals have very low IQs, most of which are no higher than that of a five or six-year-old child.: 1 (1.6%)
  - It should be possible. The potential of artificial intelligence has not yet been fully tapped. Powerful artificial intelligence can find clues to solve problems.: 1 (1.6%)
  - It is always humans who make the final decision, and artificial intelligence can only provide some reference opinions.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I would trust humans more. At this stage, I feel like it would be hard for AI to understand emotions. : 1 (1.6%)
  - I would trust humans more because we have years of experience dealing with animals and we know emotions while ai don't : 1 (1.6%)
  - I would trust humans more because resolving conflicts requires substantial emotional intelligence : 1 (1.6%)
  - I trust them equally, human had limitations on interpreting animals either way so AI could help.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I trust ai more, cuz I take it as an observer : 1 (1.6%)
  - I trust AI than ordinary people but I believe the experts can perform better than AI : 1 (1.6%)
  - I trust AI more because AI is designed by humans: 1 (1.6%)
  - I think that animal protection workers are already doing a lot and making great progress. We should pay more attention to their work.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I think I would trust AI more: 1 (1.6%)
  - I think I might expect AI to be better at resolving conflicts because it might have access to information that humans can't.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I feel like I can’t judge right now because AI technology isn’t mature enough for me to offer an opinion.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don’t think we can interpret the communication between animals, because humans don’t know what they really communicate like, and we can’t confirm the accuracy of AI interpretation.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don’t think that AI interprets animal communication more than humans because AI is designed by humans and programmed based on humans’ knowledge. To some extent, AI performs better and more than humans.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don’t believe it, because behind artificial intelligence is still human will, artificial intelligence is just a means: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't think so. Since artificial intelligence has a weak ability to interpret emotions and feelings, I don't think AI can interpret this information better.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't think so, because the current technological development makes it difficult for us to confirm the accuracy of known content, so there is a possibility of misleading: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't think humans or human-made artificial intelligence can really understand the language of animals.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't quite believe it. Humans with ulterior motives will always exist, and conflicts will not change because of animal interpretation and communication provided by artificial intelligence. It may be reduced appropriately.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't know. It's not something I've ever applied in my life and it's beyond my experience.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't know, because I can't fully trust artificial intelligence, but I still have some hope: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't believe that artificial intelligence cannot be unbiased because everything must be based on humans.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't believe it. I think there are still technical barriers for artificial intelligence to interpret animal behavior.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't believe it. Because there must be fundamental reasons for the behavior of animals. Using artificial intelligence is just to solve human problems from the perspective of humans, not to help solve the problems of animals. I don't believe there will be a win-win situation between humans and animals. Animals have been giving in to the occupation and plunder of nature by humans. Even if we know the needs of animals, humans can't do it. What can we do if we know it?: 1 (1.6%)
  - I don't believe it, I don't think there is any contradiction: 1 (1.6%)
  - I do not believe. AI is made by humans, do not forget about that: 1 (1.6%)
  - I believe that because humans have some biases when interacting with animals, but artificial intelligence does not: 1 (1.6%)
  - I believe that artificial intelligence can interpret the communication between animals because it can collect a lot of data.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I believe that artificial intelligence can better interpret the communication between animals, but I cannot ensure that the content interpreted by artificial intelligence is accurate, because a single individual does not have enough data to judge the intentions of animals. However, artificial intelligence collects a large amount of data and gives more accurate answers through training models. However, I don’t think it can completely resolve conflicts. Sometimes it may even intensify conflicts due to misjudgment.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I believe that AI, because of its greater computing power than humans, is better at pattern recognition than humans, and language itself is a pattern.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I am not sure. Overall, elephants are passing across crop fields because their habitats are getting smaller. Yes communication might help to an extent, but it doesn't solve the overal problem: 1 (1.6%)
  - I am not sure, it's hard to tell.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I am not sure AI can do a better job than humans. AI can be biased because of the training material, and can make mistakes.: 1 (1.6%)
  - I am cautious. Artificial intelligence cannot read emotions, right? How can it fully understand the communication between animals?: 1 (1.6%)
  - Half and half, maybe it can solve the conflict between humans and animals in some aspects. I can't be 100% sure.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Generally, animal behavior and communication are very complex and require long-term and careful observation, but with artificial intelligence, it is hard to say that it is intentional.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Artificial intelligence may be able to better understand the thoughts of animals, but this will not necessarily solve the conflict between humans and wild animals. People can also understand each other through language, but conflicts between people can be seen everywhere in this world.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Artificial intelligence has more data and a more sophisticated computing system. It is very scientific.: 1 (1.6%)
  - Artificial intelligence can partially interpret animal communication and help improve the relationship between humans and animals.: 1 (1.6%)
  - About the same because AI is trained by human.: 1 (1.6%)
  - AI may work better than human in resolving human - widelife confilict since AI has better collection of knowledge of experience to give better advice. Human could use AI as a tool to make decisions.: 1 (1.6%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 1.6%**

Kenya (n=51):
  - yes, its a tech built by humans: 1 (2.0%)
  - yes, i would trust AI more than humans to interpret but we can never fully guarantee that AI Can completely capture what animals are trying to say.: 1 (2.0%)
  - trust AI more since its decision can not be corupted: 1 (2.0%)
  - id trust humans more because theyd have proof of the translation or proper reason given: 1 (2.0%)
  - i wuold trust Al very much because it will be helping us: 1 (2.0%)
  - i would trust both equally because they each contribute well, i think ai will work better with human supervision: 1 (2.0%)
  - i would trust AI, because humans tend to ignorant and get tired easily: 1 (2.0%)
  - i would trust AI more. i think there is level of excellence that only the AI can achieve.: 1 (2.0%)
  - i will be a bit skeptital about that since i don't believe ai models can get hold of such information independently: 1 (2.0%)
  - i trust AI..more intelligent?

: 1 (2.0%)
  - Yes, this is because of the early warnings that might prevent an upcoming potential human-wildlife conflict: 1 (2.0%)
  - Yes and no. The AI may take advantage of the animal, but it will also communicate the animal's issues: 1 (2.0%)
  - None can be fully trusted because they can't understand animals language or intentions : 1 (2.0%)
  - No,

Human-wildlife conflict require humans to solve. : 1 (2.0%)
  - No i would not trust AI , as that will be disrupting the flows of nature: 1 (2.0%)
  - More, due to the bias of human view of correctness and animal lack of understanding of human and their boundaries.: 1 (2.0%)
  - More to resolve a human-wildlife conflict less to interpret animal communication because ai is a problem solving tool: 1 (2.0%)
  - Less because it could misinterpret wrongly and give false directive to our animals: 1 (2.0%)
  - I'm really torn in between, because the system, just like humans, is very much prone to error: 1 (2.0%)
  - I'd trust a human command using AI interpretation. AI is always neutral in it's responses and always tries to find balance. Humans know how to negotiate: 1 (2.0%)
  - I'd trust AI more than humans here. AI processes data objectively without emotional bias or economic pressures that might favor human interests over animal welfare. Humans often project their own assumptions onto animal behavior, while AI could detect subtle patterns we'd miss if properly validated.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I wouldn't trust the two. Humans will twist the information to benefit them while AI might cause misinformation.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust the AI since humans tend to be carried away by other activities hence forgetting but the AI is accurate : 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust humans more. I believe humans carry more emotion than AI.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust humans more because humans have empathy unlike AI which cannot feel emotions like humans which would be helpful in resolving the conlict.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust human more.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust Human because human beings are the one's training and building AI systems, AI response will depend from data collected by human being: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust Ai more because its fast and consistent compared to humans and also integration of complex data: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust Ai equally to human communication as both have their own level of understanding : 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI, because it uses advanced technology hence is a bit more accurate than human: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans to interpret animal communication in conflict situations because it can process vast data and recognize patterns without emotional bias. However, human insight is still essential to ensure ethical, context-sensitive decisions.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more. Human beings are prone to assumptions which many a times tend to be wrong and could lead to major consequences: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more to interpret animal communication to resolve human-wildlife conflict because AI-enabled cameras warn people when dangerous animals are nearby.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more so as to understand the animals' actions: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more since it is pattern-recorgnizing and unbiased by fear. Ai is data driven and can process massive amount of behavioural data such as movements and stress indicators. It is also devoid of fear such as fear of elephants or snakes.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more since conflict tend to arise when human beings interact with animals in the given situations. AI can come up with solutions that may help with the situation, avoiding conflict.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI more in this instance, as both animal and wildlife benefit from it's use and it has no negative motive such as poaching compared to some humans.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans because it is the humans that train the AI. : 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI just as same as humans since AI is already in use and has a positive impact.

: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust AI in an average way depending on how it has been trained : 1 (2.0%)
  - I would trust  AI because humans have not been able to resolve this all this time.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would somewhat trust both AI and humans to interpret animal communication because AI is limited to human logic, and humans can misinterpret what the animals really want: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would slightly trust ai as they would be abit accurate than humans: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would not trust AI fully because it may introduce wrong interpretation therefore escalating the conflict. Humans who can reason have the better chance.: 1 (2.0%)
  - I would equally trust each until Ai is full developed to analyze everything and give correct results: 1 (2.0%)
  - I will trust more on AI because they will provide enough security and provide efficient work to ensure human conflict wildlife is taken smoothly : 1 (2.0%)
  - I don't fully trust that because the animals wont be aware that the human is trying to communicate: 1 (2.0%)
  - I am neutral because I don't believe either would communicate accordingly: 1 (2.0%)
  - Humans, because AI is a machine and however accurate it might be it has its tonne of flaws and especially it lacks the spiritual and soul aspect of life: 1 (2.0%)
  - Ai are poised to be more accurate because unlike us we are often burdened by alot opf other things that willm limit our accuracy in the judgement and interpretation of the animal sound s and behavior. fOR this nwe might need animal specialists but for Ai there no limits they can do it flawlessly: 1 (2.0%)
  - A combination of both and Ai would work better since a weakness of one party could be a strength of the other therefore reducing chances of errors: 1 (2.0%)

United Kingdom (n=34):
  - why i might trust AI doesn’t panic, get emotional, or act out of fear. In conflict situations, humans often make snap decisions that hurt animals like calling for extermination. AI could offer calm, data-driven insights.: 1 (2.9%)
  - to prevent the chaos and live in balance with animals and also predct their movements: 1 (2.9%)
  - this would save more elephants being injured and shot as they could find better areas elsewhere that are safer for them: 1 (2.9%)
  - that example is a bit ridiculous. i dont trust ai in this example: 1 (2.9%)
  - i think i would trust humans more, not sure why, as both can make mistakes: 1 (2.9%)
  - Yes, because humans cannot analyze behavior and, for example, audio processing from digitized information: 1 (2.9%)
  - Yes, I believe it. Artificial intelligence can do more things that humans cannot do. Of course, there is a premise that artificial intelligence is used properly. Different people will have different results when using it. Good people will get good results when using it, and bad people will get bad results when using it.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Would neither trust AI nor human more, I think both would equally need to take part, AI is just a tool at the end of the day: 1 (2.9%)
  - Well, it depends on how it goes.: 1 (2.9%)
  - To be honest, I don’t think artificial intelligence can fully understand animals, but I think monitoring the actions of animals to warn humans is something we can do now, and it can reduce conflicts between humans and animals.: 1 (2.9%)
  - POtentially more ,as AI is built on big data and can potentially track patterns more accurately than humans. : 1 (2.9%)
  - No, I think artificial intelligence is developed by humans. It may be able to do better than humans in some aspects of thinking and knowledge, but this does not mean that it can do things that humans cannot, such as knowing what animals are saying to each other.: 1 (2.9%)
  - It goes both ways; trust in AI in factual communications, doubtful about interpretation of inner feelings, emotions.

Because we do not yet fully understand the minds of the animals as much as we do in human minds.: 1 (2.9%)
  - If it can be used better way, why not we give it a try: 1 (2.9%)
  - I'd trust humans more. At least humans are animals and so can communicate and have knowledge of it. An AI doesn't know how to communicate at all: 1 (2.9%)
  - I wouldn't trust them too much as there is no prove that their translation is 100% accurate: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust humans more because AI could make mistakes and we wouldn't know: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans to interpret animal communication in this context if well-designed.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust AI less, AI was created it could input the wrong information I use AI daily and the amount of times I find myself correcting it is crazy: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust AI less as a human has much more intelligence and real understanding than a computer that isnt existing in the situation: 1 (2.9%)
  - I will not rely solely on artificial intelligence to fully interpret the language of animals. I think I also need to rely on the experience I have accumulated from interacting with animals in the past.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I trust AI more than humans.  : 1 (2.9%)
  - I trust AI more because in upcoming times AI : 1 (2.9%)
  - I think it might be possible, because AI, through data accumulation and training, may be able to grasp more information than humans, so as to communicate better. However, humans still know too little about animals, and may not be able to communicate smoothly, without the medium and method of communication. AI can also adapt to the different communication methods of different types of animals, and then ask questions or respond in the best way.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I think in the scenario presented, as a warning system that could help people protect their crops from elephants, AI could be useful and likely would be trustworthy.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I think i would trust them the same amount because the AI system is run by humans.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I think I would trust AI if more developed as human error can be lethal: 1 (2.9%)
  - I think AI should be able to communicate with animals better than humans, because AI may be trained to be accurate through a large number of scientific models, but humans cannot go through this kind of training.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I believe artificial intelligence can interpret animal communication better than humans. This is modern high technology.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I am really unsure, until it does not happen it is hard to tell: 1 (2.9%)
  - I am not sure about this yet because its new and need more research to give valid answer: 1 (2.9%)
  - At present we are largely unable to interpret animal communication so AI must be able to go further and that should benefit in the resolution of conflicting interests.: 1 (2.9%)
  - AI might have limitations; whereas human finds ways to overcome shortcomings.: 1 (2.9%)
  - AI could be more impartial, not presenting data to fit its agenda: 1 (2.9%)

Canada (n=34):
  - not sure. Why not use motion detection cameras without AI? It could work, but i have doubts about reliability of the system like this: 1 (2.9%)
  - i think behaviors are situational and have to be considered under specific context. AI might not have the capability to do that and will result in miscommunication : 1 (2.9%)
  - because they're not out to harm the animal in any way: 1 (2.9%)
  - Yes. I believe AI can do a better job than ordinary people, and they will not act according to their likes and dislikes.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Yes, I believe so, because artificial intelligence can analyze animal behavior.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Trusting would be a bit hasty, but I do support the communication of some species focused on their preservation.: 1 (2.9%)
  - To the same degree, I believe that artificial intelligence is just a tool and its essence depends on the user.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Probably human more, especially trained wildlife experts. Because even though AI might help to analyze patterns faster, humans are capable of bringing context and empathy.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Not sure. I believe that physical alarms and physical prevention can reduce this occurrence. Because wild animals themselves will have conflicts with their own tribes. They are some animal groups that have not received discipline. Even if AI simulates the sound, it may further stimulate the animal's behavior.: 1 (2.9%)
  - No. I would AI give humans some ideas and let humans to verify and confirm: 1 (2.9%)
  - No, it will be manipulated by people: 1 (2.9%)
  - Neutral. It’s hard for me to give the answer without more knowledge : 1 (2.9%)
  - Maye AI can help understand the communication between animals.: 1 (2.9%)
  - MORE, theyre more objective

: 1 (2.9%)
  - I’d trust it more because of it’s recognition system and patterns : 1 (2.9%)
  - It should be able to help, because if AI can interpret the language of animals, it will be easier to provide effective assistance, especially when conflicts arise between animals.: 1 (2.9%)
  - It is possible, after all, there is some human thinking in it, but it may not be smart enough.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more for its unbiases, & data driven pattern recognition.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would trust AI less than humans because humans have been trying for a longer time to interpret animal communication to resolve a human wildlife conflict. Also, malfunctions or errors could arise with AI.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would sort of trust it as it would be helpful but also it can misread what the animals are saying which could turn sour really fast: 1 (2.9%)
  - I would not fully trust AI to interpret animal communication and resolve conflicts between humans and wildlife, because AI sometimes cannot empathize with the emotions of humans or animals, even though AI is relatively rational.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I trust AI less to interpret animals than humans, who likely have years of experience with animals they interpret, and a brain that analyzes behavior, AI has no brain, it can't "think" or use lived experience to compare new experiences and interpret and evaluate.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I think AI may have a more impartial view of animals communication than humans.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I don't trust AI. It' s hallucinate most of the things: 1 (2.9%)
  - I don't think I would trust an autonomous system like AI more than a human : 1 (2.9%)
  - I don't think AI can solve human-wildlife conflict, it's just a translator.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I don't believe it, because artificial intelligence may play more of a translation function, but it is not very clear about emotions.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I do not trust AI. As tiny little bit of mistakes in interpretation can read to hurting a lot of people: 1 (2.9%)
  - I can't offer direct response because human not angles they can act in bad ways and AI not mature enough .: 1 (2.9%)
  - I believe this is because artificial intelligence can collect large amounts of data and has strong learning capabilities.: 1 (2.9%)
  - I am skeptical about this. Artificial intelligence can be used to find patterns and compare animal behaviors and signals through patterns or big data, but I don’t think artificial intelligence has emotions.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Can help communicate and resolve conflicts, and can help people who really want to help wildlife better understand their needs: 1 (2.9%)
  - At this time, I would trust it less than humans. For now it's just an extra layer between humans and animals. The Ai just isn't good enough yet I think.: 1 (2.9%)
  - Artificial intelligence is more about assisting humans in understanding animal behavior and cannot truly replace humans in solving communication between humans and wild animals.: 1 (2.9%)

Indonesia (n=30):
  - yes, in prevent any conflict or even physically clash between living being i agree to utilize any means available to make that happen: 1 (3.3%)
  - not fully believe because maybe with AI we are able to map the animal's habitat area and can relocate them to the same area but the problem is how to make the animals understand and whether humans understand their habitat and basic instincts that always return to the starting point of their stay: 1 (3.3%)
  - more to AI, as they are less likely to be biased like human. for example, any animal expert that raised with stereotype thought of "asians eat their pets" would give biased comment regarding how animal being treated in asia: 1 (3.3%)
  - i'm skeptical of how would AI interpreting their languages, so I would trust zoologists or other scientists more than AI: 1 (3.3%)
  - i wouldn't trust AI or humans, but i would likely trust both AI and humans if used properly: 1 (3.3%)
  - at least worth a try. because ai trained by real data: 1 (3.3%)
  - Yes this AI can solve to communicate with elephant and humans conflict and with AI minimizing risk of dead human: 1 (3.3%)
  - While AI can assist with analyzing patterns in animal behavior, I believe humans—especially experienced researchers or indigenous communities—are better equipped to interpret animal communication. They bring emotional intuition, contextual understanding, and ethical awareness that AI lacks.: 1 (3.3%)
  - Well maybe more to AI cause i think ai would do something they asked to do and a human there is a bad and good people which is a grey area i think i would prefer to trust more based on something that it fixed: 1 (3.3%)
  - Trust AI more, because it can read patterns : 1 (3.3%)
  - Probably AI, if the development is more advanced and accurate.: 1 (3.3%)
  - No. You need compassion to understand them, and AI has none of it: 1 (3.3%)
  - No, AI is just a tool to make things easier... the one who can solve the conflict between animals and humans is humans themselves.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I’d trust AI more for consistency and speed in detecting threats. Humans may misinterpret signals, but AI lacks bias. However, ethical oversight is crucial to ensure fairness: 1 (3.3%)
  - It's worth a try. If the case you have presented can be a success, the conflict between human and animals can be avoided.: 1 (3.3%)
  - It is not a question of if I trust the AI. It is a question of if I trust the humans programming said AI to not be biased and program it to give humans more leeway or advantage to do harm to the animals. And my answer to whether I trust a human to be unbiased with AI is absolutely no.: 1 (3.3%)
  - It depends, if it's for good things to know what they want, then I think it is goo,d except they're gonna use it to be able to exploit the animals and their places, because when things go wrong, they can't speak for themselves except being mad to us: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust it more since it makes decisions based on data instead of using emotions: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more, because it can process large amounts of behavioral data objectively and consistently. However, human oversight is still crucial to ensure cultural and ecological context is respected.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI more, because AI used gathered data, train the model, and interpret based on the data. : 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI more than human in the sense of AI can work based on mega data. : 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI less than human. : 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI because it can process data quickly and detect patterns humans might miss. It can also work to prevent conflicts, like warning farmers before elephants arrive.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI based on neutral stance than trusting humans with cunning nature: 1 (3.3%)
  - I will trust human better than AI because we have more better thinking and mind: 1 (3.3%)
  - I think it's 50:50. Sometimes animal experts can already interpret what animals mean because they have an emotional bond with them, while AI interprets based on hundreds of inputs, which might often be correct—although it can also be wrong.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I still believe in human. AI is just a tool.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I guess I'd trust AI more especially if it can prevent human animal conflict like the one mentioned above, because humans sometimes just can't control their anger : 1 (3.3%)
  - I don't trust AI to resolve conflicts between humans and animals because AI lacks empathy, moral judgment, and a true understanding of nature.
Conflicts involving animals often require a deep appreciation of ecological balance, cultural values, and ethical considerations—things that go beyond data and algorithms. AI may analyze behavior or predict outcomes, but it cannot truly understand the emotional, environmental, or spiritual connections humans have with animals. Relying solely on AI risks o: 1 (3.3%)
  - For now I don't believe in AI technology. Especially to understand animal language. I think the elephant could have reached the farmland because it was hungry. It's clear that there is a lack of food and the most likely reason is that its natural habitat has been destroyed : 1 (3.3%)

Brazil (n=30):
  - Yes, because AI would work in favor of what it was programmed for, in this case, people of good faith will be able to create in a way that benefits humans and animals, but I don't trust humans themselves.: 1 (3.3%)
  - Yes, I would. The reason is partly due to the computational power of AI systems.: 1 (3.3%)
  - To resolve a communication conflict, perhaps an AI would be the best idea.: 1 (3.3%)
  - No. We are different things in needs. There cannot be such a possibility.: 1 (3.3%)
  - No more, no less. Since this is still an experience, we should be cautious.: 1 (3.3%)
  - More on AI, as long as it was well trained and free of bias.: 1 (3.3%)
  - In this specific case, I would trust AI more, because from what I understand, this is an old conflict that has not been resolved by humans to this day.: 1 (3.3%)
  - In my experience with AI so far, AI seems to have a greater ability to take a neutral view of conflicts and resolve the issue more rationally and without ulterior motives than humans.: 1 (3.3%)
  - If the AI can interpret animals extremely well, I would tend to trust it more.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I'm not sure. AI, no matter how intelligent, still has flaws and is programmed.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I wouldn't trust it. Animals are by nature unpredictable, I disagree that it is likely to predict a behavior with certainty every time.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust more because it does not have human malice and evil.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust less, I think you don't understand feelings completely: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust it more. AI, being a machine, ends up being much faster and more efficient in this type of situation than humans. Even if it makes mistakes sometimes, the cost benefit will probably be greater.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust it less, because we don't yet have such precision.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust if the model used was graded by a person who is familiar with animal behavior.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust humans even more in their ability to understand and want to protect their species and others as well.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI more. Because in a way, we do understand what an animal is trying to say. When a dog growls, we know it is angry because we understand certain patterns. I believe that AI could understand animal communication patterns that we still don't understand.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I would trust AI more, because I think it would help save more animals and avoid greater damage to society in environmental issues.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I trust less because we can't have 100% confidence in anything.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I trust AI to identify patterns and act quickly, but I believe the final interpretation must combine technology with common sense and human empathy.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I trust AI more than humans: 1 (3.3%)
  - I trust AI because it can help a lot: 1 (3.3%)
  - I think it might be possible, because it is more neutral.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I think in humans. Resolving conflicts involves interpreting emotions, I wouldn't trust an AI with that.: 1 (3.3%)
  - I believe that humans can be more treacherous than AI, acting in bad faith and bringing incorrect information for their own gain.: 1 (3.3%)
  - For the early detection and treatment capacity of complex problems, such as activating emergency/security systems.: 1 (3.3%)
  - Because man generally does not try to resolve conflicts but rather creates them: 1 (3.3%)
  - At the current moment, I would trust a human more, as a human's ability to understand and express an emotion is much greater than that of an AI.: 1 (3.3%)
  - As long as it was a system monitored by both those directly affected and independent bodies that represented animal and environmental interests, yes.: 1 (3.3%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 3.3%**

Chile (n=28):
  - more so if good results are demonstrated: 1 (3.6%)
  - Yes, it's a tool that could help resolve some of these conflicts. We could learn the animal's point of view.: 1 (3.6%)
  - Yes, I would trust AI more because it can detect patterns more accurately and quickly compared to humans who are typically only reactive.: 1 (3.6%)
  - Not yet, because I might hallucinate.: 1 (3.6%)
  - No, I wouldn't trust it at all. Using AI causes environmental damage; it's unbelievable to believe we're contributing something while damaging it.: 1 (3.6%)
  - More, because humans are more open with their ideological biases: 1 (3.6%)
  - Likewise. Although it's a powerful tool, as described, there's no certainty that it's suitable for use by humans.: 1 (3.6%)
  - It's a strange question. I can't imagine a conflict with animals. Animals wouldn't go to war or any other kind of confrontation with humans! I would ask most people to know where they feed and breed, so as not to affect their life cycle.: 1 (3.6%)
  - It would depend on the information you have regarding how advanced the AI is.: 1 (3.6%)
  - It depends on the human being. I trust scientists and animal behavior experts more than AI. But I trust AI more than an average human.: 1 (3.6%)
  - It depends on the ethical aspects that govern said AI. If it is an AI regulated to prevent animal abuse, it may interpret animals better than many humans.: 1 (3.6%)
  - If used for risk prevention I think it would be very effective.: 1 (3.6%)
  - If I had no other choice but to trust AI then yes. But like I have stated above, I would not fully trust AI because I would not be a hundred percent certain that the interpretation is a hundred percent accurate.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I wouldn't trust either humans or AI: 1 (3.6%)
  - I wouldn't rely too much on AI, because I think it's very volatile, and generative AI models don't have the ability to reason. A biased model might try to disrupt communication to resolve the conflict, which isn't what wildlife is looking for.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would trust it, but not 100%. AI is an automated mechanism that, without fail, requires human oversight to function optimally. Until now.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would trust it less since I don't think AI can understand much beyond what's programmed, much less emotions or the true feelings that come from life.

: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would trust if all the possibilities were sought that it could work.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would trust a trained AI more since it can be replicated in many places. Humans, no matter how expert they are, require years of learning and experience to perform that task well and could not be present 24 hours a day in all the places they are required to be; AI could perform those tasks efficiently.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would trust AI more than humans, because humans often have economic interests in animals.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would only trust AI as it is subject to scrutiny by authorities in the scientific community.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I would like it to be used on a scale appropriate to the vulnerability of animals. Always with a certain degree of foresight, and a balance in favor of the animals. I think it could help if carefully designed and managed by experts, with ethics always at the forefront.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I think these conversations should be monitored to prevent them from being used for the benefit of certain people who want to exploit them.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I think I'd trust that, since human bias would be necessary for training. As long as they aren't harmed, I think it would help prevent crop deterioration.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I think I wouldn't rely more on one or the other, but rather on a mix of AI and human interpretation, so that it's more complete.: 1 (3.6%)
  - I d  not trust one more than the other.: 1 (3.6%)
  - But humans are prone to lying. AI only lies if it is programmed or allowed to.: 1 (3.6%)
  - AI, taking into account that it is an impartial tool, unlike humans, especially if they are negatively affected by the conflict.: 1 (3.6%)

Germany (n=25):
  - i would trust humans more to interpret their pet animal but not wild ones. Because they have a bond with their pets: 1 (4.0%)
  - Yes, as humans have limited capacity to keep every obtained data, whereas AIs are trained on every piece of data: 1 (4.0%)
  - Yes ,It will reduce casualities and dangers to both human and animals

: 1 (4.0%)
  - Well AI is made by humans so it comes down to quite the same outcome : 1 (4.0%)
  - No. Its still too early. We need to wait for AI to improve: 1 (4.0%)
  - It's very hard to answer without any data on how effective AI can be in such a use case. But my intuitive answer is I would trust AI more, since it is not subject to things like emotion, state of mind, tiredness or other factors that might affect decision making. It can make decisions quicker and depending on the training data/model it is less biased towards a specific decision than humans.: 1 (4.0%)
  - It totally depends. If the human is an expert for this species and has studied them for decades, I would totally trust this human more than any AI. If it's about humans in general, I think I would trust AI more than the humans.: 1 (4.0%)
  - It really depends on the stage of development but in general i'd trust AI more because it can detect patterns humans simply can't. There is a reason we have never been able to communicate with animals in their "language": 1 (4.0%)
  - I'm conflicted because I'd generally trust a human more, but also an AI has a way bigger database of animal behaviors that can help interpret animal communication.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust it more, especially if the AI is programmed in a way that makes it more neutral in such conflicts. Humans always think what it is best for them, but AI could potentially be neutral.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust humans more, the right,good humans. They have more experience and do their jobs for decades. AI is not ready for this.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust Ai more since it analyses millions of examples and it should be able to get a better understandinf of the animal communication than a human who has seen around thousand of these animals: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more than humans in interpreting animal communication for conflict resolution, because AI can process large amounts of data objectively and detect patterns humans might miss. However, human oversight remains essential to avoid errors, bias, or unintended consequences and to ensure ethical decisions.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust AI slightly more because it has more collected data it can rely on compared to a human: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust AI more as humans are the one who are involved in poaching and illegal hunting of elephants. Moreover, the human resources are limited, so we cannot assure that all fields can be monitored by humans. So the use of AI is the logical step to ensure the prevention of crops.  : 1 (4.0%)
  - I would trust AI less because right now their capability is not very advanced as the AI developers claim: 1 (4.0%)
  - I would only trust humans to handle this situation due to ai being fairly error prone in some cases.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I think, more, because I want to understand for helping: 1 (4.0%)
  - I dont trust AI now, but that could change if it shows that it works.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I don't believe it. Because the living range of humans is constantly expanding, solving the conflict between humans and wild animals is to make wild animals compromise with human expansion. This is not to resolve the conflict, but to send a signal to animals to stay away.: 1 (4.0%)
  - I am neutral about that. It should be used in a good manner.: 1 (4.0%)
  - Humans more, because they can better understand subtle changes in behaviour.: 1 (4.0%)
  - At least artificial intelligence is smart, it follows the program, it does not have any emotions of its own, and it is not limited like the human brain.: 1 (4.0%)
  - Ai could help preventing the extinction of rare species: 1 (4.0%)
  - AI is constructed by humans and tends to copy their biases, plus there is potential to technical errors. So, generally speaking the same.: 1 (4.0%)
  - **Trusts AI More: 4.0%**
