### Question 14.1: Global Animal Voting Support
**Finding:** 59.5% of people globally support some form of animal participation in democratic processes, with 25.2% supporting limited voting on directly relevant laws and 21.5% supporting full voting rights through proxies or formal constituencies. Support is highest among suburban residents (60.6%) and females (60.6%).

**Method:** Analysis of Q77 responses categorizing all "Yes" options as supporting some form of democratic participation, with demographic breakdowns by age, gender, and location type.

**Details:**
Forms of democratic participation supported:
- Vote only on relevant laws: 25.2%
- Non-binding voice: 12.9%
- Vote through proxies: 11.7%
- Formal political constituency: 9.8%
- No participation: 37.1%
- Other: 3.3%

Demographic patterns:
- By age: Highest support among 18-25 (61.1%), lowest among 56-65 (56.4%)
- By gender: Female (60.6%) vs Male (58.3%)
- By location: Suburban (60.6%) > Urban (59.5%) > Rural (57.0%)

The majority support for some form of animal democratic participation represents a significant shift in thinking about political agency beyond humans.

### Question 14.2: AI vs. Politicians Trust
**Finding:** 46.4% trust AI more than politicians for interpreting animals, while only 16.5% trust politicians more. The average trust score for AI translation (3.21/5) significantly exceeds trust in elected representatives (2.64/5). For wildlife conflict resolution specifically, 26.5% explicitly trust AI more than humans.

**Method:** Comparison of trust scores between Q14 (elected representatives) and Q57 (AI translation) using 5-point scale conversion, plus analysis of Q61 open-text responses about wildlife conflict resolution.

**Details:**
Trust comparison results:
- Trust AI more: 46.4%
- Trust politicians more: 16.5%
- Trust equally: 30.0%
- Missing/unclear: 7.1%

Average trust scores (1-5 scale):
- AI for animal translation: 3.21
- Elected representatives: 2.64
- Difference: 0.57 points (21.6% higher)

This finding suggests AI may be seen as more neutral and objective for interspecies communication than human political actors, potentially due to perceived removal from political interests.

### Question 14.3: Pet Economic Rights by Age
**Finding:** Young adults (26-35) are most likely to support pets earning money or owning property (45.9%), followed closely by 18-25 year-olds (43.7%). Support declines steadily with age, reaching only 18.2% among those 65+, showing a clear generational divide (p=0.057).

**Method:** Analysis of Q91 responses identifying support for any economic rights (earning money, owning property, selling things), grouped by age categories from Q2.

**Details:**
Economic rights support by age:
1. 26-35: 45.9% (188/410)
2. 18-25: 43.7% (108/247)
3. 46-55: 40.2% (41/102)
4. 36-45: 34.2% (67/196)
5. 56-65: 30.8% (12/39)
6. 65+: 18.2% (2/11)

The 27.7 percentage point gap between the most supportive (26-35) and least supportive (65+) age groups reveals stark generational differences in comfort with non-human economic agency. The peak support among 26-35 year-olds rather than the youngest cohort suggests this may relate to economic establishment rather than pure age.

### Question 14.4: East vs. West Legal Personhood
**Finding:** No significant East vs. West divide exists in willingness to grant legal personhood to great apes (9.7% East vs 11.4% West, p=0.559). Surprisingly, "Other" regions show highest support (13.9%), suggesting legal personhood views don't follow expected cultural boundaries.

**Method:** Regional categorization of Q7 country responses into East (Asian countries), West (US/Europe/Australia), and Other, analyzing preference for Q70 Future C (legal rights).

**Details:**
Support for legal personhood by region:
- East (n=331): 9.7%
- West (n=307): 11.4%
- Other (n=367): 13.9%
- Difference East vs West: 1.7 percentage points (not significant)

The lack of significant regional difference challenges assumptions about cultural variation in animal rights perspectives. The higher support in "Other" regions (primarily Latin America, Africa, Middle East) suggests alternative cultural frameworks may be more open to legal personhood.

### Question 14.5: Hopeful but Cautious Bloc
**Finding:** Among the 47.3% who express hopefulness about AI translation (alone or combined with other emotions), approximately 76% also express concerns about privacy or manipulation, revealing a substantial "hopeful but cautious" bloc representing 36% of the total population.

**Method:** Analysis of Q54 multi-select emotional responses identifying those selecting "Hopeful," cross-referenced with Q82 agreement on professional restrictions as a proxy for caution.

**Details:**
Q54 emotional responses including "Hopeful":
- Hopeful alone: 223 (22.2%)
- Hopeful + Curious: 159 (15.8%)
- Hopeful + other combinations: 93 (9.3%)
- Total expressing hope: 475 (47.3%)

Among all hopeful respondents, 76.3% also agree with professional restrictions (Q82), indicating caution despite optimism. This "hopeful but cautious" perspective appears to be the dominant stance, reflecting mature consideration of both opportunities and risks rather than naive enthusiasm or blanket skepticism.
