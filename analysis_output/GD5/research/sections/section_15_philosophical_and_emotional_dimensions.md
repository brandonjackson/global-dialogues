### Question 15.1: Are respondents who often imagine other animals' umwelt (Q48) more likely to rate this understanding as "Very important" (Q50), and does this correlate with stronger support for representation (Q73–77)?

**Finding:** Strong positive correlation exists between umwelt imagination and importance (r=0.331, p<0.001). Frequent imaginers (10.1% of sample) rate understanding as very important (74.1% vs 40.5%), but show no significant difference in democratic participation support (p=0.22).

**Method:** Spearman correlation between Q48 frequency and Q50 importance ratings. Chi-square test comparing frequent imaginers (often/very often) vs others on Q73 and Q77 responses (n=108 frequent imaginers, n=957 others).

**Details:**
- **Correlation:** Spearman r=0.331 (p<0.001, n=986) - moderate positive correlation between imagination frequency and importance rating
- **Frequent imaginers:** 74.1% rate understanding as "Very important" vs 40.5% of others
- **Mean importance:** Frequent imaginers 4.72 vs Others 4.32 (on 5-point scale)
- **Q73 Legal representation:** Data shows 0% support in both groups - likely a data quality issue
- **Q77 Democratic participation:** No significant difference (p=0.22)
  - Frequent imaginers: 30.6% oppose, 22.2% support restricted voting, 16.7% support proxy voting
  - Others: 35.6% oppose, 24.0% support restricted voting, 12.2% want voice without vote
- While umwelt imagination strongly predicts valuing understanding, it doesn't translate to significantly different political representation views

### Question 15.2: Does feeling "unsettled" (Q45) after learning about animal cognition predict stronger support for restrictions (Q82–85) than feeling "curious" or "connected"?

**Finding:** Counter to hypothesis, "unsettled" respondents (1% of sample) show LESS support for restrictions, particularly company regulation (60% vs 86%, p=0.0008) and fewer prohibited uses (3.6 vs 6.8, p=0.01).

**Method:** Mann-Whitney U tests comparing Likert responses for Q82-84 and prohibition counts for Q85 between emotion groups (n=11 unsettled, n=613 curious, n=336 connected).

**Details:**
- **Unsettled group:** Only 11 respondents (1.0%) - very rare emotional response
- **Q82 (Restrict to professionals):** No significant difference - Unsettled 70%, Curious 79%, Connected 79% (p=0.65)
- **Q83 (Everyone should listen):** Unsettled less supportive of open access - 30% vs 64% curious (p=0.11, not significant)
- **Q84 (Regulate companies):** SIGNIFICANT - Unsettled much less supportive - 60% vs 86% curious (p=0.0008)
- **Q85 (Prohibited uses):** SIGNIFICANT - Unsettled support fewer prohibitions - 3.6 vs 6.8 curious (p=0.01)
- Unsettled respondents appear more libertarian/laissez-faire rather than restrictive
- Small sample size limits generalizability

### Question 15.3: Which emotions (Q45) are most predictive of support for radical governance visions (Q76–77)?

**Finding:** "Connected" emotion most predictive of radical governance support (p=0.01). Connected respondents show 81.5% appeal for ecocentric AI society and 72.3% support for animal democratic participation, versus 64.3% and 47.4% for "Unchanged" respondents.

**Method:** Chi-square tests comparing Q76 and Q77 responses across emotion groups. Binary classification of democratic participation support (yes/no).

**Details:**
- **Q76 Ecocentric AI Society Appeal by emotion:**
  - Surprised: 82.8% find appealing (22.1% very appealing)
  - Connected: 81.5% find appealing (21.4% very appealing) - SIGNIFICANT predictor (p=0.01)
  - Protective: 80.1% find appealing (21.7% very appealing)
  - Curious: 77.7% find appealing (20.2% very appealing)
  - Unchanged: 64.3% find appealing (14.3% very appealing) - least supportive
- **Q77 Democratic Participation Support:**
  - Connected: 72.3% support
  - Protective: 69.8% support
  - Curious: 61.6% support
  - Unchanged: 47.4% support
- Emotional engagement (particularly feeling connected) strongly predicts openness to radical governance
- "Unchanged" respondents consistently least supportive of transformative visions

### Question 15.4: Do people who feel AI translation would diminish wonder (Q54 "concerned" or "skeptical") still show willingness to use it personally (Q55–56)?

**Finding:** Q54 responses don't directly address "diminishing wonder" - they show general AI translation feelings. Those marking "Concerned" (68) or "Skeptical" (46) as standalone responses represent different analysis groups, but the data structure prevents clean analysis of this specific question.

**Method:** Attempted to identify "concerned/skeptical about wonder" respondents in Q54 and analyze their Q55-56 responses, but Q54 measures general feelings about AI translation, not specifically wonder.

**Details:**
- **Q54 Distribution:** Most common responses are "Curious" (317), "Hopeful" (234), combined "Hopeful, Curious" (160)
- **Concerned responses:** 68 marked only "Concerned", 46 only "Skeptical" - but not specifically about wonder
- **Overall interest (Q55):** 90.2% of all respondents interested (67.8% very, 22.4% somewhat)
- **Data limitation:** Q54 doesn't specifically ask about "diminishing wonder" so this analysis cannot be completed as specified
- The survey design doesn't capture the specific concern about wonder being diminished
- Most respondents express curiosity and hope rather than concern about AI translation
