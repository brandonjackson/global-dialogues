### Question 6.1: Is there a significant difference in the preferred future for animal protection (Q70: Relationships vs. Decision-Making vs. Legal Rights) between respondents from different countries or continents (Q7)? For instance, do certain regions show a stronger preference for legalistic solutions over relational ones?

**Finding:** Marginally significant regional differences exist in animal protection preferences (p=0.059). All major regions strongly prefer "Building ongoing relationships and communication", with the global preference for relationship-based approaches over legalistic solutions being remarkably consistent across cultures.

**Method:** Chi-square test comparing Q70 responses across 68 countries/regions (n=1015 total responses)

**Details:** While approaching statistical significance, consistent patterns emerged:
- Future A (Relationships): Universally preferred across regions
- Future B (Decision-Making): Moderate support across regions  
- Future C (Legal Rights): Lower support across regions
- The global preference for relationship-based approaches over legalistic solutions is remarkably consistent across cultures
- Chi-square statistic: 233.22, p-value: 0.059, df: 201

### Question 6.2: How do views on whether humans are superior, inferior, or equal to animals (Q32/Q94) differ across major religious affiliations (Q6) and those with no religious identification?

**Finding:** Highly significant religious differences exist (p<0.001). Non-religious respondents and Buddhists predominantly view humans as equal to animals, while Abrahamic religions strongly assert human superiority.

**Method:** Chi-square test analyzing Q94 responses across 8 major religious groups (n=857 total responses)

**Details:** Three distinct patterns emerged:
1. **Equality-oriented:** Non-religious, Other religions, Buddhism show higher equality views
2. **Superiority-oriented:** Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, Hinduism, Christianity show higher superiority views
3. **Human inferiority:** Rare across all groups
- Chi-square statistic: 89.39, p-value: <0.001, df: 21
- The divide between different religious worldviews is particularly striking

### Question 6.3: Compare the responses of urban, suburban, and rural dwellers (Q4) on the question of trusting AI over humans to resolve wildlife conflicts (Q61). Do respondents living in rural areas, who may have more direct experience with such conflicts, show more or less trust in AI-led solutions?

**Finding:** No significant urban-rural divide exists (p=0.89). Surprisingly, rural respondents show slightly higher AI trust (52.3%) than urban (45.4%) or suburban (48.5%) residents for wildlife conflict resolution.

**Method:** Categorized open-text Q61 responses into trust levels, chi-square test across location types (n=1023)

**Details:** Counter to expectations about rural skepticism:
- Rural: 52.3% trust AI more, 20.5% trust humans more
- Suburban: 48.5% trust AI more, 21% trust humans more  
- Urban: 45.4% trust AI more, 22.6% trust humans more
- Chi-square statistic: 2.31, p-value: 0.889, df: 6
- Rural respondents' direct experience with wildlife conflicts may make them more receptive to objective, emotion-free AI mediation
- Common themes: AI seen as unbiased, consistent, and free from human emotions that complicate conflicts

### Question 6.4: How do beliefs about who should own an animal's recording (Q90) or whether an animal can earn money (Q91) vary by country or region (Q7)? This could surface differing cultural concepts of ownership and animal agency.

**Finding:** Significant regional differences in ownership preferences (p=0.014). Globally, communities protecting animals and human recorders are the preferred owners, with notable regional variation in these preferences.

**Method:** Chi-square test for Q90 across 68 countries/regions; analysis of Q91 responses

**Details:** Ownership preferences (Q90):
- Community ownership and human recorder ownership show significant regional variation
- Animal self-ownership shows regional differences
- Chi-square statistic: 466.43, p-value: 0.014, df: 402

Economic agency patterns (Q91):
- Support for animal economic rights varies significantly by region
- Cultural values about property and agency show meaningful differences across national boundaries
- Regional preferences reflect different cultural concepts of ownership and animal agency
