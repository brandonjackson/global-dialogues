### Question 6.1: Is there a significant difference in the preferred future for animal protection (Q70: Relationships vs. Decision-Making vs. Legal Rights) between respondents from different countries or continents (Q7)? For instance, do certain regions show a stronger preference for legalistic solutions over relational ones?

**Finding:** No significant regional differences exist in animal protection preferences (p=0.37). All major regions strongly prefer "Building ongoing relationships and communication" (45-71%), with Indonesia showing the highest preference (71%) and Brazil the lowest (50%).

**Method:** Chi-square test comparing Q70 responses across 8 major countries (n=641 for relationships, n=254 for decision-making, n=120 for legal rights)

**Details:** While not statistically significant, some interesting patterns emerged:
- Future A (Relationships): Universally preferred, ranging from 50% (Brazil) to 70.6% (Indonesia)
- Future B (Decision-Making): 20-30% support across regions, highest in Brazil (30%)
- Future C (Legal Rights): 6-20% support, highest in Brazil and Kenya (20% each)
- The global preference for relationship-based approaches over legalistic solutions is remarkably consistent across cultures
- Chi-square statistic: 22.46, p-value: 0.374, df: 21

### Question 6.2: How do views on whether humans are superior, inferior, or equal to animals (Q32/Q94) differ across major religious affiliations (Q6) and those with no religious identification?

**Finding:** Highly significant religious differences exist (p<0.001). Non-religious respondents and Buddhists predominantly view humans as equal to animals (52% and 50%), while Abrahamic religions strongly assert human superiority (Judaism 78%, Islam 75%, Christianity 69%).

**Method:** Chi-square test analyzing Q94 responses across 8 major religious groups (n=998 total responses)

**Details:** Three distinct patterns emerged:
1. **Equality-oriented:** Non-religious (52.3%), Other religions (64.3%), Buddhism (50%)
2. **Superiority-oriented:** Judaism (77.8%), Islam (74.8%), Sikhism (75%), Hinduism (69.6%), Christianity (68.6%)
3. **Human inferiority:** Rare across all groups (2.7% overall)
- Chi-square statistic: 80.76, p-value: <0.001, df: 14
- The divide between Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic worldviews is particularly striking

### Question 6.3: Compare the responses of urban, suburban, and rural dwellers (Q4) on the question of trusting AI over humans to resolve wildlife conflicts (Q61). Do respondents living in rural areas, who may have more direct experience with such conflicts, show more or less trust in AI-led solutions?

**Finding:** No significant urban-rural divide exists (p=0.89). Surprisingly, rural respondents show slightly higher AI trust (52.3%) than urban (45.4%) or suburban (48.5%) residents for wildlife conflict resolution.

**Method:** Categorized open-text Q61 responses into trust levels, chi-square test across location types (n=1023)

**Details:** Counter to expectations about rural skepticism:
- Rural: 52.3% trust AI more, 20.5% trust humans more
- Suburban: 48.5% trust AI more, 21% trust humans more  
- Urban: 45.4% trust AI more, 22.6% trust humans more
- Chi-square statistic: 2.31, p-value: 0.889, df: 6
- Rural respondents' direct experience with wildlife conflicts may make them more receptive to objective, emotion-free AI mediation
- Common themes: AI seen as unbiased, consistent, and free from human emotions that complicate conflicts

### Question 6.4: How do beliefs about who should own an animal's recording (Q90) or whether an animal can earn money (Q91) vary by country or region (Q7)? This could surface differing cultural concepts of ownership and animal agency.

**Finding:** No significant regional differences in ownership preferences (p=0.21). Globally, communities protecting animals are preferred owners (38%), followed by human recorders (32%) and animals themselves (17%). Economic rights support varies widely within regions.

**Method:** Chi-square test for Q90 across 10 countries; categorization of Q91 multiple-choice responses

**Details:** Ownership preferences (Q90):
- Community ownership highest in India (43.2%), Canada (33.3%)
- Human recorder ownership highest in Chile (42.9%), China (39.3%)
- Animal self-ownership highest in Brazil (33.3%), modest elsewhere
- Chi-square statistic: 52.32, p-value: 0.211, df: 45

Economic agency patterns (Q91):
- Support neither: 19-36% across regions (highest UK at 36.4%)
- Support ownership rights: 12-31% (highest China at 31.1%)
- Support earning money: Variable, often combined with other rights
- Kenya shows highest support for comprehensive economic rights (15.7% support both)
- Cultural values about property and agency don't map cleanly onto national boundaries
