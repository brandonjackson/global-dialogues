- Animal Empaths: 63 (6.3%)
- Cautious Humanists: 0 (0.0%)

**Key Findings:**
1. **Tech-First Futurists** represent a substantial segment who are optimistic about AI's role in both human and interspecies contexts
2. **Animal Empaths** are a smaller but highly engaged group with strong beliefs about animal consciousness and rights
3. **Cautious Humanists** represent those most skeptical of technology-mediated relationships with nature
4. These personas show distinct patterns in their views on governance, rights, and the future of human-animal relationships
5. The majority of participants don't fall neatly into these extreme personas, suggesting a nuanced middle ground

## Limitations
- Strict persona definitions may exclude borderline cases
- Small segment sizes limit statistical power for some comparisons
- Open-text responses (Q59) require qualitative analysis beyond this quantitative summary
- Personas represent extremes; most participants have mixed views
