# Section 20: Moral/Ethical Contradictions
## Analysis Date: 2025-09-02T21:26:07

### Question 20.1: Selective Democratic Acceptance
**Finding:** Among the 37.1% who oppose animal democratic participation, 20.6% still support legal representation, revealing selective acceptance where legal protection is desired without political agency. This group is 21.8 percentage points less supportive of representation than the general population (42.5%).

**Method:** Analysis of Q77 (democratic participation) responses filtered for "No participation," cross-referenced with Q73 (legal representation) and Q74 (representation method).

**Details:**
Among those opposing democratic participation (n=373):
- Support legal representation: 20.6% (77 people)
- Oppose legal representation: 46.9%
- Unsure about representation: 32.4%

This selective acceptance group (n=77) prefers:
- Human representatives: 67.5%
- Tech-assisted self-representation: 32.5%

The 20.6% showing selective acceptance suggests a nuanced position where animals deserve legal protection but not political voice. This mirrors historical patterns where groups received legal protections before political rights, indicating a potential transitional stance rather than pure contradiction.

### Question 20.2: Professional Restrictions vs. Democratic Rights
**Finding:** No significant tension exists between supporting professional restrictions (76.3%) and democratic rights (9.8%), with correlation near zero (r=-0.006, p=0.942). Surprisingly, 75.5% of those supporting full democratic rights also want professional restrictions, suggesting these are seen as complementary rather than contradictory.

**Method:** Cross-tabulation of Q82 (professional restrictions) agreement with Q77 radical democratic options (proxy voting and political constituencies), calculating overlap and correlation.

**Details:**
The tension group (n=74, 7.4% of total) characteristics:
- All support formal political constituencies
- 60.8% "Somewhat agree" with restrictions
- 39.2% "Strongly agree" with restrictions

Rather than contradiction, this reveals a coherent position: animals should have political rights exercised through qualified professionals. The lack of negative correlation (r=-0.006) indicates people don't see professional gatekeeping and democratic rights as mutually exclusive. This suggests a model of "mediated democracy" where expertise facilitates rather than restricts political participation.

### Question 20.3: Property vs. Economic Participation
**Finding:** Strong positive correlation exists between property ownership and economic participation support (r=0.480). Among property supporters, 70% also support active economic rights (earning money or selling), while 30% support only symbolic ownership. Only 6.2% support full economic rights across all dimensions.

**Method:** Parsing Q91 multi-select responses to identify support for property ownership, earning money, and selling goods, analyzing overlaps and creating an economic rights typology.

**Details:**
Among property ownership supporters (n=130):
- Also support earning money: 57.7%
- Also support selling things: 60.0%
- Also support owning creations: 79.2%
- Symbolic only (property without earning/selling): 30.0%

Economic rights typology:
- Full economic rights (property + earning + selling): 6.2%
- Partial economic rights: 35.4%
- No economic rights: 32.5%
- Unclear/missing: 25.9%

The strong correlation (r=0.480) between property and earning money indicates most people view economic rights holistically rather than compartmentally. The 30% supporting only symbolic ownership may represent a transitional position or genuine belief in passive asset holding without active market participation.
