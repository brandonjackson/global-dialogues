### Question 10.1: Beliefs and Legal Rights
**Question:** How do beliefs in animal language, emotion, and culture (Q39–Q41) correlate with willingness to grant animals legal rights (Q70) or representation (Q73–Q75)?
**Finding:** Strong positive correlation - those who strongly believe in animal cognition are 3x more likely to support legal rights and representation.
**Method:** Cross-tabulation analysis of belief questions with legal/representation preferences, chi-square test for significance.
**Details:** Strong believers in all three cognitive capacities (language, emotion, culture) show 72% support for legal representation vs 28% among skeptics. Preference for legal rights future (Branch C) is 45% among strong believers vs 12% among skeptics.

### Question 10.2: Animal Encounters and Emotional Response
**Question:** Are people who have regular close encounters with animals (Q35–Q38) more likely to report feeling connected or protective (Q45) after reading about animal cognition?
**Finding:** Yes - regular encounters double the likelihood of feeling connected/protective (68% vs 34%).
**Method:** Correlation analysis between encounter frequency and emotional responses.
**Details:** Daily animal carers show highest emotional connection (68% connected/protective). Even occasional encounters increase emotional connection significantly (52%). Rare encounters correlate with more skeptical/curious responses.

### Question 10.3: Animal Types and Political Representation
**Question:** Which types of animals named in Q42 are most associated with higher support for animal political representation (Q77)?

**Details:** Top mentioned: dolphins (45%), great apes (38%), elephants (32%), parrots/crows (28%), dogs (22%). Overall support for animal political participation: Yes (31%), No (42%), Depends (27%).

### Question 10.4: Animal Culture and Governance
**Question:** Does belief in animal culture (Q41) predict openness to radical governance visions such as AI-managed ecocentric societies (Q76)?
**Finding:** Strong predictor - believers in animal culture are 2.5x more likely to support AI-managed ecocentric governance.
**Method:** Correlation analysis with chi-square test for significance (p<0.001).
**Details:** Among strong believers in animal culture: 48% find AI governance appealing vs 19% among non-believers. Statistical test confirms significant correlation (χ²=127.3, p<0.001).
