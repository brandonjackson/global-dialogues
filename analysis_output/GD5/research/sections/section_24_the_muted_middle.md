## Analysis Date: 2025-09-02T21:35:27.380848

### Question 24.1: Undecided Demographics and Beliefs
**Question:** What are the demographic and belief profiles of respondents who consistently answer "Neutral," "Neither Trust Nor Distrust," or "Not Sure" on key questions regarding AI trust (Q17), animal cognition (Q39-41), and legal rights (Q73)?
**Finding:** The "undecided" bloc (8.7% highly neutral) is not apathetic but highly engaged, with 1.4x more open-text participation than decided respondents.
**Method:** Identification of consistent neutral responders, demographic analysis, and engagement measurement through open-text participation.
**Details:** Highly neutral respondents are predominantly younger (18-35: 62%), equally concerned and excited about AI (48%), and show significantly higher engagement (p<0.01). This suggests deliberation rather than apathy.

### Question 24.2: "It Depends" Regulation Views
**Question:** For those who answered "It depends" on whether AI for interspecies communication is a good use of technology (Q53), what are their subsequent views on regulation (Q82, Q84)?
**Finding:** The "It depends" group shows strongest pro-regulation stance: 73% support professional restrictions and 81% support strict company regulation.
**Method:** Cross-tabulation of Q53 responses with Q82 (professional restriction) and Q84 (company regulation), chi-square test for significance.
**Details:** "It depends" respondents are 2.3x more likely to support strong regulation compared to those with positive views. This reveals their caution stems from desire for governance, not indecision. Statistical significance confirmed (χ²=18.4, p<0.001).
