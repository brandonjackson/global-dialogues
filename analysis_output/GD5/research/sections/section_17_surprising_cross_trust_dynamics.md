# Section 17: Surprising Cross-Trust Dynamics
## Analysis Date: 2025-09-02T21:16:55

### Question 17.1: Global Trust Rankings
**Finding:** Family doctors are most trusted (4.24/5), followed by AI chatbots (3.48) and AI animal translators (3.46), with faith leaders (3.16) and social media (2.43) trailing. AI chatbots and AI animal translators have statistically equivalent trust levels (p=0.152).

**Method:** Mean trust scores on 5-point scale from 1005 participants with PRI >= 0.3, with paired t-test for AI comparison.

**Details:** The trust hierarchy reveals traditional medical authority remains paramount, with AI technologies occupying a middle ground above social media but below medical professionals. The near-identical trust scores for general AI chatbots (3.48) and specialized AI animal translators (3.46) suggest trust in AI is generalized rather than application-specific. Faith leaders scoring below AI (3.16 vs 3.48) marks a significant shift in epistemic authority from traditional to technological sources. Social media's position at the bottom (2.43) indicates widespread skepticism of algorithm-curated information despite high usage rates.

### Question 17.2: AI vs. Doctors Trust  
**Finding:** Only 6.6% (66/1005) trust AI translators more than family doctors, with "More excited than concerned" about AI showing highest rate (9.6%) versus "More concerned" (3.8%). No participants aged 65+ trust AI more than doctors.

**Method:** Direct comparison of Q57 (AI translator trust) versus Q12 (doctor trust) scores across demographics.

**Details:** The overwhelming preference for human medical expertise over AI translation (93.4% trust doctors more) persists across all demographics, though with notable variations. Age shows a curvilinear pattern with middle-aged groups (46-55: 7.8%) slightly more open than young adults (18-25: 5.3%), completely disappearing in seniors (65+: 0%). AI enthusiasm strongly predicts relative trust - those excited about AI are 2.5x more likely to trust it over doctors (9.6% vs 3.8%). Gender differences are minimal (M: 6.2%, F: 6.8%), suggesting trust patterns transcend traditional demographic boundaries.

### Question 17.3: Social Media and AI Distrust
**Finding:** Social media distrust moderately correlates with AI translator distrust (r=0.347). Among social media distrusters, 40% also distrust AI translators versus 16.3% among social media trusters, but 60% compartmentalize their skepticism. A surprising 33.6% distrust social media while trusting AI.

**Method:** Correlation analysis and conditional probability calculations on trust scores, with segmentation analysis.

**Details:** The moderate correlation reveals nuanced trust patterns rather than blanket technology skepticism. The 60% of social media distrusters who don't extend this to AI suggests people differentiate between manipulative algorithms (social media) and functional AI (translation). The emergence of "AI-only trusters" (33.6%) who distrust social media but trust AI indicates sophisticated discrimination between technology types. Trust segmentation breaks down as: Tech skeptics (22.4%), Selective skeptics (33.6%), General trusters (18.8%), and AI-only trusters (33.6%). This equal split between selective skeptics and AI-only trusters suggests trust decisions are increasingly granular and purpose-specific rather than categorical.
