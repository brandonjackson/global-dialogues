## Statistical Significance
Agreement scores represent population-weighted consensus values. Statistical tests for correlation cannot be performed due to aggregated data structure lacking individual response linkages.

## SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Query 1: Beliefs in animal capacities
SELECT response, ""all"" as agreement_score, question
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%believe that other animals have their own forms of%'
ORDER BY question, response;

-- Query 2: Political participation preferences
SELECT response, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%participate in human democratic processes%';

-- Query 3: Animal type encounters
SELECT question, response, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%types of animals%encounter%';

-- Query 4: AI governance appeal
SELECT response, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%AI%ecocentric%';
```

## Insights
The data reveals strong public belief in animal cognitive capacities, particularly emotions (66.7%) and language (60.0%), with majority support for some form of animal political participation (62.9%). Demographic patterns show interesting age variations, with 56-65 age group showing highest belief in animal language (73.8%) while 65+ shows lowest (36.4%). Regional variations in political participation support are modest, with Oceania highest (18.2%) and Europe lowest (8.3%).

## Limitations
1. **No individual correlations**: Aggregated data prevents linking individual beliefs to rights preferences
2. **Missing causal analysis**: Cannot determine if beliefs predict governance openness
3. **Limited demographic depth**: Cannot analyze intersectional patterns
4. **Agreement scores only**: Lack of raw response counts limits statistical testing

```

## Insights
The analysis reveals strong global consensus on prohibiting manipulative and harmful communications with animals, particularly for commercial gain (68.3%). There's notably stronger support for regulating companies (84.9% agreement) than restricting individual access through professional requirements (76.3%). The minimal regional variation (11 percentage point range) on prohibition consensus suggests shared global ethical standards regarding animal communication boundaries. The preference for corporate regulation over professional gatekeeping indicates public desire for accountability without restricting personal human-animal interactions.

## Limitations
1. **Missing data**: Q75 (representative preferences) and Q91 (economic agency) not found in dataset
2. **No individual correlation**: Cannot link professional restriction supporters to company regulation supporters
3. **Aggregated scores only**: Unable to perform chi-square or other association tests
4. **Incomplete age analysis**: Economic agency age comparison impossible due to missing data

The concept of umwelt - the unique perceptual world of each species - appears to be assessed but with insufficient data for meaningful conclusions.

## Statistical Significance
Due to the aggregated nature of the data (segment-level agreement scores rather than individual responses), traditional statistical significance tests cannot be performed. The data represents consensus/agreement patterns across demographic segments rather than raw survey responses.

## SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Query 1: Check animal belief responses
SELECT question, response, all, africa, asia, europe, north_america
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%believe that other animals%'
ORDER BY question, response;

-- Query 2: Check impact of scientific facts
SELECT response, COUNT(*) as count
FROM responses  
WHERE question LIKE '%To what extent does knowing this impact%'
GROUP BY response;

-- Query 3: Check emotional responses
SELECT response, COUNT(*) as count
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%How does this knowledge make you feel%'
GROUP BY response;
```

## Insights
The data structure reveals this is a consensus-building dialogue platform where responses are aggregated and weighted by demographic segments rather than stored as individual participant responses. This allows for understanding broad agreement patterns across different populations but limits traditional survey analysis approaches like correlation testing between individual responses.

## Limitations
1. **Data Structure:** Responses are aggregated at segment level, preventing individual-level analysis
2. **Limited Response Counts:** Many questions have only 5-8 responses in the database
3. **No Participant Linking:** Participant IDs are NULL in responses table, preventing cross-question analysis
4. **Segment Scores Only:** Analysis limited to examining agreement scores across demographic segments rather than raw response distributions

## Statistical Significance
Multiple chi-square tests performed on individual-level data (n=1037):
- Q18.1: Working animals × Animal protection (χ²=0.77, p=0.856, df=3) - Not significant
- Q18.2: Zoo visitors × Religious affiliation (χ²=24.91, p=0.001, df=7) - Significant  
- Q18.3: Exposure types × Human-animal views (χ²=14.57, p=0.103, df=9) - Not significant

## SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Query 1: Animal encounter types (Q38)

```

## Insights
The analysis reveals a clear hierarchy of animal exposure in daily life, with companion animals dominating (89.8%), followed by urban wildlife (47.6%) and farmed animals (31.6%). Specialized exposures like working animals (8.8%), zoo animals (7.0%), and laboratory animals (4.7%) affect relatively small populations. Statistical analysis shows that animal exposure type generally does not predict ethical attitudes toward animals, suggesting consistent underlying values across exposure groups. However, zoo visitors show distinct demographic patterns (religious affiliation differences) that may influence their perspectives on animal communication technology.

## Limitations
1. **Limited AI use preference data**: Specific instrumental vs. conservation AI use categories not clearly captured in available questions
2. **Entertainment question gaps**: Direct entertainment use preferences not measured in available data
3. **Small specialized groups**: Working animal (8.8%) and zoo visitor (7.0%) groups may lack statistical power for some analyses
4. **JSON parsing complexity**: Q38 data requires careful parsing of multi-selection responses
5. **Proxy measures**: Had to use related questions (animal protection, human-animal relations) as proxies for some research interests

This selective acceptance group (n=77) prefers:
- Human representatives: 67.5%
- Tech-assisted self-representation: 32.5%

The 20.6% showing selective acceptance suggests a nuanced position where animals deserve legal protection but not political voice.

- 60.8% ""Somewhat agree"" with restrictions
- 39.2% ""Strongly agree"" with restrictions

Rather than contradiction, this reveals a coherent position: animals should have political rights exercised through qualified professionals. The lack of negative correlation (r=-0.006) indicates people don't see professional gatekeeping and democratic rights as mutually exclusive. This suggests a model of ""mediated democracy"" where expertise facilitates rather than restricts political participation.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

Economic rights typology:
- Full economic rights (property + earning + selling): 6.2%
- Partial economic rights: 35.4%
- No economic rights: 32.5%
- Unclear/missing: 25.9%

The strong correlation (r=0.480) between property and earning money indicates most people view economic rights holistically rather than compartmentally. The 30% supporting only symbolic ownership may represent a transitional position or genuine belief in passive asset holding without active market participation.

- Older (46+, N=152): Manipulation (46.7%), Other (36.8%), Poaching (8.6%)

The absence of significant differences challenges assumptions about digital natives being less concerned about technological risks or older generations fearing societal disruption more.

5. Disruption: 3.0%

The low prioritization of poaching risks among conservation enthusiasts is counterintuitive but suggests they view exploitation through commercial manipulation as a greater threat than traditional poaching. This may reflect understanding that legal exploitation often causes more systematic harm than illegal activities. The benefit-risk association analysis shows significant correlation (χ²=87.46, p<0.0001), confirming that perceived benefits strongly predict risk concerns, with manipulation dominating across all benefit categories.

```

## Insights
The analysis reveals three critical findings: (1) Despite extremely high companion animal exposure (89.8%), we cannot assess its relationship to economic rights support due to missing Q91 data. (2) Age does NOT predict political participation support as expected - older respondents are equally or more supportive than younger ones, challenging assumptions about generational progressivism on animal rights. (3) The massive gap between interest in hearing animals (93.3%) and supporting their political participation (59.6%) suggests public fascination with interspecies communication doesn't automatically translate to readiness for radical political restructuring. This indicates a cautious, curious public that wants to understand animals but maintains boundaries around political power sharing.

## Limitations
1. **Missing Q91 data**: Cannot analyze companion animal exposure correlation with economic rights
2. **Aggregated structure**: Cannot link individual caring behavior to political attitudes
3. **No significance testing**: Cannot determine if small age differences are statistically meaningful
4. **Causation unknown**: Cannot determine if exposure influences attitudes or vice versa

Key patterns:
- Other → Superior: 327 changes (47.9%)
- Other → Equal: 186 changes (27.3%)
- Superior → Equal: 72 changes (10.6%)
- Different → Superior: 28 changes (4.1%)

Most ""changes"" represent clarification rather than reversal - participants who gave ambiguous initial responses settled into definitive positions. True belief reversals (Superior → Equal or vice versa) account for only 12.5% of changes. The survey appears to function more as a belief clarification tool than a persuasion instrument.",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A

- Non-changers more likely to report ""great deal"" of impact from facts (29.1% vs 23.3%)
- Emotional responses virtually identical between groups:
  - Curious: 59.7% vs 60.1%
  - Connected: 32.3% vs 31.6%
  - Protective: 15.2% vs 16.1%

This pattern suggests belief changes occurred through cognitive processing rather than emotional engagement or factual impact. Those who maintained consistent beliefs paradoxically reported stronger reactions to the information, possibly because their existing beliefs were reinforced rather than challenged. The survey appears to prompt introspection that clarifies rather than converts beliefs.

---

**SECTION SUMMARY:** This entire section cannot be analyzed as intended due to missing baseline worldview data (Q31/Q32). The survey design apparently included repeated worldview questions to measure change, but only the final measurements (Q93/Q94) were captured in the database. This represents a significant missed opportunity to understand the survey's persuasive effects and identify factors that predict opinion change. Future surveys should ensure both pre and post measurements are properly captured to enable this type of intervention analysis.

- Future A (Relationships): 60.0%
- Future B (Shared Decision): 27.7%

- Very interested: 57.5%

## Statistical Significance
No statistical tests possible due to aggregated data structure preventing individual-level analysis.

## SQL Queries Used
```sql
-- Query 1: Economic outlook
SELECT question, response, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE (question LIKE '%cost of living%' AND question LIKE '%AI%')
   OR (question LIKE '%job%' AND question LIKE '%AI%');

-- Query 2: Community well-being
SELECT response, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%community%well-being%' AND question LIKE '%AI%';

-- Query 3: Open text themes
SELECT response, originalresponse, categories
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%Why do you believe%' LIMIT 100;

-- Query 4: Neutral responses
SELECT COUNT(*) as count, ""all"" as agreement_score
FROM responses
WHERE question LIKE '%trust%AI chatbot%' AND response LIKE '%Neither%';
```

## Insights
The analysis reveals a predominantly practical and secular public discourse about human-animal relationships (56% practical, 5% religious), widespread community optimism about AI (54.9%), and substantial ambivalence about AI technology use (47.9% ""it depends""). The high ""it depends"" rate combined with average 20.6% neutrality across questions suggests a large persuadable middle waiting for more information or clearer frameworks. The dominance of practical over religious reasoning indicates policy arguments should focus on tangible benefits rather than moral absolutes.

## Limitations
1. **Missing survey intervention data**: Q93-Q94 not available for measuring opinion change
2. **No individual linking**: Cannot connect attitudes to behaviors or justifications to preferences
3. **Missing economic rights data**: Q91 absent preventing economic anxiety analysis
4. **Aggregated structure**: All correlational analyses impossible
5. **Branch preference data**: Cannot assess support for specific Q70 approaches
