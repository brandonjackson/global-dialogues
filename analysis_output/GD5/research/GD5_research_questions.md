# GD5 Research Questions on Interspecies Communication

## 1. Scientific Understanding & Public Awareness

1. How aware is the public of scientific evidence that animals (e.g., whales, dolphins, elephants, bees) use complex communication systems, including "names," dialects, and cultural transmission?

2. Do people believe animal communication systems are comparable to human language (syntax, semantics), or do they view them as simpler signals?

3. How much trust do people place in scientists' ability to interpret animal signals accurately?

4. Where does the public's understanding of animal communication come from? (e.g., scientific documentaries, fictional media like movies and books, personal experiences with pets, cultural stories).

5. Do people believe that certain animals (e.g., dolphins, elephants, bees) possess consciousness, sentience, and complex inner lives? How does this belief correlate with the perceived complexity of their communication?

6. Do people feel they can already "understand" the emotions or intentions of certain animals (especially their own pets) without technology?

## 2. AI as a Mediator of Interspecies Communication

1. To what extent does the public trust AI systems to "translate" or interpret animal communication?

2. Do people believe AI can uncover meaning in animal vocalizations, or only patterns?

3. How comfortable are people with AI-generated "translations" being presented as accurate representations of animal thoughts or emotions?

4. Which use cases of AI in interspecies communication do people find most acceptable (e.g., conservation, animal welfare monitoring, entertainment, pet communication)?

5. How optimistic are people that AI will be able to genuinely "translate" or "decode" animal communication? Do they view AI as a simple pattern-detection tool or as a potential bridge to true two-way conversation?

6. How much trust would the public place in an AI-powered translation of animal communication? What level of scientific validation would they require to believe the outputs are accurate and not just algorithmic projections?

7. Are people concerned about the limitations of AI, such as algorithmic bias and the risk of anthropomorphism? Do they worry that a flawed AI could lead to a harmful misunderstanding of animal needs or intentions?

8. What role do people believe human experts (e.g., biologists, ethologists) should play in validating and interpreting the outputs of these AI systems?

## 3. Ethical Concerns & Moral Boundaries

1. Do people believe animals have interests in privacy or autonomy that could be violated by constant monitoring and AI decoding?

2. Should animals have any form of "consent" considered in the use of AI tools that attempt to interpret or broadcast their communications?

3. Are people more concerned about under-interpreting animal signals (failing to recognize their complexity) or over-interpreting them (anthropomorphizing incorrectly)?

4. Would evidence of sophisticated animal communication change people's views on animal rights, welfare standards, or personhood?

5. If AI enabled us to understand the expressed wants and needs of a species, how should this impact their moral and legal status? Should they be granted certain rights (e.g., personhood, the right to not be harmed or exploited)?

6. What are the biggest ethical concerns regarding this technology? (e.g., using it to manipulate or exploit animals for commercial gain, military purposes, or entertainment; invading animal privacy; disrupting natural behaviors).

7. Would a proven ability to understand animal communication create a moral obligation for humanity to act on that knowledge? For example, if whales expressed distress about ocean noise, would we be obligated to change our behavior?

## 4. Philosophical Frames & Public Intuitions

1. Do people think it is even possible to "truly" understand another species' umwelt (subjective perceptual world), or is all translation inevitably human-centered?

2. Are people excited by the possibility of interspecies communication (e.g., whales, elephants), or do they view it with skepticism or discomfort?

3. To what extent do people see AI-mediated interspecies communication as beneficial for humans (e.g., scientific knowledge, empathy, conservation) versus for the animals themselves?

4. Does the prospect of "solving" animal communication diminish a sense of wonder or mystery about the natural world for some people? Is there a belief that some things should remain unknown?

## 5. Societal Application and Governance

1. What do people see as the most important and beneficial applications of this technology? (e.g., accelerating scientific research, enhancing animal welfare and conservation, deepening the human-animal bond, commercial applications).

2. Who should oversee the development and deployment of this technology? (e.g., scientific bodies, government agencies, international consortia, private corporations). Should the data and technology be open-source or proprietary?

3. How do people imagine this technology impacting their own lives? If they could use a validated "animal translator," what would they ask their pet, a wild animal, or a farm animal?
