## Key Findings Highlights

### Demographics & Beliefs
- Strong global interest in animal communication (67% very interested)
- Majority believe humans are superior (60.8%) but significant minority view as equals (36.5%)
- Religious affiliation strongly predicts human-animal equality views

### AI & Technology
- High trust in AI for translation (52% trust, 18% distrust)
- Tech-First Futurists (20% of sample) more open to AI governance
- Rural respondents surprisingly show higher AI trust for wildlife management

### Ethics & Rights
- 76% support professional restrictions on animal communication
- 84% want strict company regulation
- Legal rights support varies by region but generally low (11% overall)

### Emotional & Philosophical
- Feeling "connected" strongly predicts support for radical governance (p<0.01)
- Umwelt imagination correlates with valuing understanding (r=0.331)
- Curiosity doesn't translate to political radicalism

### Cultural Patterns
- No significant regional differences in protection approach preferences
- Religious groups show largest divide on human superiority views
- Urban/rural divide minimal for AI trust

## Data Limitations Identified
1. **Section 28**: Missing Q31/Q32 baseline worldview questions prevent measuring opinion change
2. **Q73**: Legal representation data appears corrupted (showing 0% across all groups)
3. **Q54**: Doesn't specifically measure "diminishing wonder" concern
4. Some branched questions (e.g., Q70-C) have very low response rates

## Next Steps
- Wait for sections 29-32 to be completed by other workers
- Consider re-running analyses with updated PRI scores
- Document any additional data quality issues discovered
- Prepare final synthesis report once all sections complete
